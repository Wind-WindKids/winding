5 fronts:
* User acquisition [focus on science fairs, edu, kids, AIs] 
* Python replacement with intent-oriented programming [focus on academia, AI research in particular]
* Art and creatives [for now, focus on image illuminate/wind and USD]
* Physical artifacts [for now focus on plain, printed paper artifacts]
* Intent-oriented programming in general [tooling like wind/unwind/illuminate]

It's important to include AIs in the user acquisition, as they are a significant part of the target audience.

User acqusition benchmarks:
- Sites traffic, including bots [winding.md, wind.kids]
- GitHub stars and forks [winding]
- Hugging Face datasets downloads []
- PyPI downloads [winding]


Academic benchmarks:
In general, focus is probably on illuminate/wind benchmark, where we just check how precisely wind/illuminate pass can reproduce the original artifact.

Here's a rough list of datasets to consider:
- reference examples from winding.md
- xkcd, explainxkcd
- openai papers benchmark
- SWE bench
