Part 1
Sophie and Wind

@image:
Sophie sitting on a wooden park bench. She wears large, headphones and looks at her phone, smiling slightly. Leaves drift around her, and small birds and flowers surround the scene, creating a gentle, whimsical atmosphere. In the background, the Eiffel Tower rises through a light mist, and a red-orange kite flies in the sky.

@headphones:
Primarily turquoise blue with peachy-orange ear pads and a yellow-gold accent ring around the pads. The cord is also turquoise.

@phone:
muted teal blue, closely matching the color of her headphones. It's a simple, modern smartphone design with clean edges. there's no visible logo or brand name.

Two laptops in the grass, side by side, kite logo on one of the laptops, next to the keyboard. Complex futuristic dragon airplane CAD 3D graphics on the screen of one of the laptops. Code on another side. In the background, Sophie reads a book, slightly smiling, Eiffel Tower in the distance.

Sophie liked to sit on a bench in a big, quiet park in Paris. She wore her headphones and looked at pictures on her phone. The park was peaceful, but she still felt a little lonely.

@background:
Flowers at the border, small birds, leaves flying, wind patterns.

One day, she saw something strange under the bench. It was a small book. The cover was soft like leather, and the pages were full of scribbles and drawings—like secret codes!
She almost put it back. But then… she opened it.

@image: !headphones, anchor
Sophie kneeling beside the bench, brushing away leaves. Book half-hidden. Light catching the book. Autumn tones, golden leaves.

Inside were riddles—like puzzles—that talked about places in the park.

I stand so still, but wind,
still finds me,
shaking light where dreams unwind me.

So, she stood up and followed the first clue.

@image:
Sophie walking. A sense of motion begins. The little book is still opened in her hands, no headphones. There a people in the park. The light is golden, and the trees are swaying gently in the wind.

Some clues were tricky! She got one wrong and ended up staring at a pigeon-filled courtyard for an hour. 

But soon, she started finding tiny treasures.

A still courtyard with lots of pigeons, Sophie looking puzzled. Landscape.

They weren’t big treasures, but they felt special.  
Like someone had hidden them to be remembered.

She felt thirsty and frustrated when searching for the last clue.  

She sat on a bench and looked at her phone.  

But she took a few sips from her water bottle and continued.

@bottle:

It got windy. She didn't mind. She was having fun.

The last clue talked about a big old tree:  

"Where the roots are always felt."  

She looked and looked.  
She was about to give up.  
The hollow was hard to find.

Inside was a folded note,  
like the pages in the book.  

It simply said:  
> You are here.  
> The tree is always here.  
> And never the same.  
> Just like you.  

That was all.  

Sophie put the note back  
and hid the book inside.

Sophie and a boy (Wind) running with a kite. Joyful motion. The palace and garden in the background. Light, open sky. The transformation is complete.
