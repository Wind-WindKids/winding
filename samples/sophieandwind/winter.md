Sophie and Winter

@image:
Sophie standing at the rail of a bench in the Luxembourg Gardens in winter. Bare trees, pale sky, her scarf lifted by a breeze. The Eiffel Tower faint in the background. She looks toward the distance as if imagining someplace far away.

It was winter, and Wind was away.  
Every winter, he left Paris for the other side of the world.

One gray afternoon, Sophie’s mother smiled at her over the kitchen table.  
“How would you like to go to Winter Camp in California?  
It’s at Wind’s school.”  

Sophie’s spoon stopped halfway to her mouth.  
“Really?”  
“Really.”

The next month, Sophie packed her small suitcase.
She was going to San Francisco, to see Wind.
She folded her clothes neatly, took a few books, a few chocolate bars,
and her favorite toy that she had since she was a baby — Bashful Lamb.

Her dad drove them to the airport, with her brother in the backseat, teasing her about Wind the whole way.

At the airport, her dad hugged her tight.  
“Sophie, be gentle with Wind, he loves you,” he said. 
“And come back in one piece.”

Her brother grinned and parroted, “Be gentle with Wind, no biting…” — rubbing his arm.  

“I still can’t believe Mom and Dad are letting you go overseas alone,” he added.  

Dad laughed. “She’s ready. And the world’s ready for her.”

Her brother relaxed, preppy, next to her mom, one hand rubbing his arm. Mom's hair is dark brown, brother in late tweens. Behind them, travelers move toward the security queue; Bashful Lamb peeks from the side pocket of Sophie’s bag.

She went quickly through the security, no line, no waiting.
Sophie felt a little nervous, it went so fast, and she was alone now.

The flight was the 
longest 
and 
most 
boring 
she had ever taken.

She texted Wind as soon as she landed:
*I’m here!*

And she got a reply right away:
*I’m here too!*  
*See you soon!*

When she stepped out of the plane, the air smelled different, warm. 
And in another half an hour, there was Wind, grinning at her.

Wind called a car from his phone and inside typed on the screen: “Sunnyvale.”  

Sophie snorted. “That’s not a real place.”

Wind laughed. “It is as real as Eden, or Luxembourg,” you'll see.

The car eased forward, merging into the stream of cars, then slid toward the airport exit.

Wind’s townhouse looked bigger on the inside. 
Light poured in from skylights and wide windows.  
The living room ceiling rose so high it felt like a hall.  

Sophie sank into a golden-yellow sofa, the travel catching up to her.  
“No sleeping now! Let's go to the pool, get some air.”  

Five minutes later they were splashing in the turquoise water.
After the swim, they rode their bikes to the ice cream shop,
at a small pedestrian square, full of restaurants and cafes.

On Sunday, Wind’s dad bought tickets for a sailing trip, 
they drove over the hills to the ocean.
The air smelled of salt and sunlight, 
and soon they were aboard a white catamaran.

On Sundays in winter Paris, decorations, candles, and  
hymns were the highlight of the season. 
But here, she leaned on the forward rail beside Wind, 
hair flying, spray on her cheeks.

Wind’s dad smiled. “You kids are right in your elements,” he called.
“I’ve always loved the water and the wind. That’s how Wind got his name.”

Sophie grinned, “This is almost like flying,” she said.

Wind laughed. “Almost.”

The next day, Wind took Sophie to his school, for a winter camp.
It was a bilingual school, with a big courtyard and around sixty kids at the camp.
Sophie felt shy at first, but kids were friendly to a newcomer from Paris.
They played games, made art, it was fun.

@image:
The courtyard of a school. Children playing, Sophie and Wind among them. A few trees, a low building with large windows, and bright blue sky overhead.

And then, the next day, Wind told her a secret.

“I can fly, here, in California. I have a real airplane.”

Sophie looked at him, puzzled. “What do you mean? How can you have an airplane?”



“It's not possible in Paris, but here, in California, rules are not the same," he said, grinning,  

“It's an ultralight, an eGull, 
and there are no restrictions for kids to fly it, 
rules are this way. It is called Part 103.”

“No license. Daytime only. Away from crowds. And no passengers,” Wind added,
like he’d said it a hundred times.

The FAA does not impose minimum age requirements for operating ultralight vehicles under Part 103.

That afternoon, after camp, Wind led Sophie past the hangars at the airport. The air smelled of sun-warmed asphalt and oil.

“Wait — it's yours? You really can fly an airplane?” Sophie stared at him.  

“Yeah. I’ve been flying since I was eight,” Wind said. “Here, I can.”  

She looked at the little white eGull. “It’s so small. Where do I sit?”  

Wind grinned. “You don’t. It’s only got one seat.”  

“One seat? That’s not fair. You can't take me?”

“No passengers, I'm not allowed,” Wind said, sadly.
“So if you want to fly with me, you have to learn.”  
“Okay, I want to learn!” Sophie replied eagerly.

"How can I learn to fly it?” Sophie asked, eyes bright. 
"Can I get in?"

“Sure — but it’s tied down. There'll be no flying today.”  

And we'll need to close the canopy, if you want to see everything.
The eGull was a single-seater, but it was designed for an adult,
so they squeezed together in the cockpit, and Wind closed the canopy.

Wind switched on the instruments, and the screen in the center lit up.

On the canopy, a shimmering shape of lines appeared, forming a tiny golden dragon.
Sophie stared, her eyes wide. And the golden lines shifted, dragon eyes looked at her.

“It’s looking at me.”  

Wind smiled. “It’s a dragon. Here, put on the headset.”  

Through the soft hiss of the headset, a warm, deliberate voice:  
*"Hello. I know Wind. But what is your name?"*

The same evening, they sat in Wind’s room, the eGull simulator on a large screen.

Wind grinned: “Sorry, it's not the real eGull, and it's ancient — it’s like three years old.”
He puts on the headset: “Hey Dragon, can you teach Sophie to fly?”

“Of course, Wind.”, the Dragon’s voice answered.

Sophie sat in the chair, putting on the headset.
The dragon's voice filled the headset, warm and deliberate:

"Welcome Sophie. Let's begin with level flight."

Wind sat beside her, watching.

The next evening, dragon's voice now familiar: "Let's practice turns at minimum airspeed."

She trimmed the eGull and entered a slow turn to the left, 
her lips tight, trying to fly as slow as she could.

"Sophie, you are flying too slow."

The horizon tilted. The stall warning beeped.
The dragon's voice, calm but firm: "I have control."

But Sophie's hands stayed frozen on the stick, knuckles white.

"Let go!" Wind said urgently. "Dragon needs to fly!"

The beeping grew louder. The horizon spun. Sophie pulled harder, trying to fix it.

Everything was rotating backwards now, faster and faster.
The dragon's voice, still calm but urgent: "Sophie, push the stick forward. Now."
But her hands wouldn't move. The little eGull spiraled down, spinning, until—
The screen went black.
Silence.
The scene on the screen changed. The eGull, now broken, hung in the treetops of a steep hill.

"What have you done to my dragon?", Wind teased.

"Sophie, we are going to learn stalls, but not today," Dragon said. 
"Today is for learning to turn level, at minimum airspeed, constant bank, and in balance."

Next attempt. Same slow flight turn to the left. Same warning beep.
"Sophie, you are flying too slow."
The dragon's voice: "I have control."
This time, Sophie's hand relaxed on the stick, "You have the control".
On the screen, ghostly dragon wings overlaid the eGull. The horizon steadied. The beeping stopped.
The valley returned, peaceful and level.
"Good," Dragon said. "We are at the level flight again. You can have the control."
Sophie took the stick again, lighter this time.
"What if I mess up again?"
"Then you will say three words: 'You have control.' And I will fly."
"Always?"
"Almost always. Sometimes I may need your help."  Dragon said.
Wind smiled.

They were getting the hang of it and practicing landings. 
One time, it was looking good on a glide to final, 
Sophie closed her eyes for a moment — 
a quick wish for luck — 
like many people do when landing.

The plane drifted off the centerline, 
and she couldn't quite get it back.

She had to abort the approach,
and do it all over again.

The Dragon spoke gently:  
“Sophie, a perfect landing is like catching a ball.  

Imagine you play catch with Wind.  
You throw the ball—  
and instead of playing,  
he closes his eyes.  

Would he catch the ball?”  

Sophie sighed, “No, of course not.”  

She tried it again. And again.
And again.

And in time, she could land the little eGull,
gently, on the centerline, every time.

christmas_day: page, text, centered

The winter camp parties were fun, with music and dancing, Christmas lights and decorations. The camp friends were nice, and Sophie felt happy.

But Christmas Day was not the same. The sun had just risen in California when she called her family — but in Paris, daylight was already fading. They went to church that day, her mom insisted. The church was all wrong. It was supposed to be the same everywhere. It wasn't. The litany in English was incomprehensible; they stayed politely to the end, relieved to step back into the sun.

Wind didn’t like the church. He only remembered faintly that it had caused arguments between his parents. And then there were rumors.  

They had planned flying, but by the time they reached the airfield, the weather had turned restless. Gusts picked up, lessons were canceled, and they went home disappointed.

The New Year came, and camp started again after the Christmas break. During the holidays she had flown several times in a real airplane, with an instructor. Her training progressed. She kept her eyes open, steady on the controls, flying with precision.

And one morning, Wind told her she was ready.
Ready for the real eGull.

That afternoon, Sophie sat in the real eGull, headset snug over her ears.  
Wind’s voice crackled over the radio from the grass beside the taxiway:  
“Nice and slow, okay?”  

The dragon’s voice followed, warm and deliberate:  
“Today we will learn to taxi. Use gentle pedal pressure.”  

She didn't get to fly, but she got to control a real airplane.

On her last night, the clubhouse glowed with string lights.  
A few camp friends came to say goodbye.  
There was music, paper lanterns, and a few kisses — completely unabashed, like in the movies.

The next morning at the airport, they had to say goodbye.

Two weeks of winter holidays with Wind had flown by like two years… or like one day.  
And then it was time to go back, into the winter in Paris, without Wind.

Somewhere over the ocean, Sophie closed her eyes.  
The airplane hummed, and she could almost hear the headset again —  

The dragon’s voice, calm and deliberate:  
“Let’s begin with level flight.”

Outside her window, an impossibly high white cloud drifted in the shape of a luminous seagull.
