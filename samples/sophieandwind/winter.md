One gray afternoon, 
Sophie’s mother smiled at her over the kitchen table.  
“How would you like to go to Winter Camp in California?  
It’s at Wind’s school.”  

Sophie’s spoon stopped halfway to her mouth.  
“Really?”  
“Really.”

The next month, Sophie packed her small suitcase.
She was going to San Francisco for a winter break.
She took her clothes, books, a few chocolate bars,
and her favorite toy she’d had since she was a baby.

Her dad drove them to the airport, 
with her brother in the backseat, 
teasing her about Wind the whole way.

At the airport, her dad hugged her tight.  
“Sophie, be gentle with Wind, he loves you,” he said. 
“And come back in one piece.”

Her brother grinned and parroted, 
“Be gentle with Wind, no biting,” — 
he said, rubbing his arm.  

“I still can’t believe Mom and Dad are 
letting you fly overseas alone,” he added.  

“Dad laughed. “She’s ready. 
And the world’s ready for her.”

Her brother, in late tweens, relaxed, preppy, next to her mom, one hand rubbing his arm. Mom's hair is dark brown. Behind them, a few people passing through the security, no security guards visible; Small Bashful Lamb toy peeks from the side pocket of Sophie’s backpack with Hawaiian patterns.

She went quickly through the security,

Sophie felt a little nervous, 
it went so fast, 
and she was alone now.

The flight was the longest and 
most boring she had ever taken.

She texted Wind as soon as she landed:
*I’m here!*

And she got a reply right away:
*I’m here too!*  
*See you soon!*

When she stepped out of the plane, 
the air smelled different, warm. 
And in another half an hour, 
there was Wind, 
and they were hugging tight.

Wind called a car from his phone and typed: 
*“Sunnyvale.”*  

Sophie snorted. “That’s not a real place.”

Wind laughed. “It is as real as Eden — 
or the Jardin du Luxembourg,” you'll see.

The car eased forward, 
merging into the stream of cars, 
then slid toward the airport exit.

Wind’s townhouse looked bigger on the inside. 
Light poured in from skylights and wide windows.  
The living room ceiling rose so high it felt like a hall.  

Sophie sank into a golden-yellow sofa, 
the travel catching up to her.

“No sleeping now! To the pool”, Wind said.  

Five minutes later they were splashing in the turquoise water.

After the swim, they rode their bikes.

right there in the neighborhood.

They rode past a park, schools,

at a small pedestrian square, 
full of restaurants and cafes.

The next day, Wind took Sophie to his school, 
for a winter camp.

It was a bilingual school, 
with a big courtyard and 
a lot of kids at the camp.

Sophie felt shy at first, 
but kids were friendly to a newcomer from Paris.
They played games, made art, it was fun.

And then, Wind told her a secret.

“I got my own eGull," he said, grinning.

Sophie's eyes went wide. "Wait—your own? Like, yours?”

“Yeah. My dad and I found one. It's at the airport now.”

“But... why? You can't fly it by yourself, anyway.”

“It's an ultralight, and I'll fly it by myself soon,
there are special rules here — Part 103,
No license. Away from crowds. No passengers,” 
Wind added, like he’d said it a hundred times.

“It's really yours? Electric, right? Wow,”
Sophie stared at him.  

She looked at the little white eGull,
“It’s so small. Where do I sit?” 

Wind grinned. “Here. But the eGull only has one seat.” 

“One seat? Can we fit in, both of us?”

“Can I see inside? Can I sit in it?” Sophie asked, eyes bright. 

“Sure — but it’s tied down. 
There'll be no flying today.”  

The eGull was a single-seater, 
but it was large enough for two kids,
so they squeezed in together.

Wind closed the canopy, switched on the instruments, 
and the screen in the center lit up.

On the canopy, a shimmering shape of lines appeared, 
forming a tiny golden dragon.

Sophie stared, her eyes wide. 
And the golden lines shifted, dragon eyes looked at her.

“It’s looking at me.”  

Wind smiled. “It’s a dragon. Here, put on the headset.”  

Through the soft hiss of the headset, a warm, deliberate voice:  
*"Hello. I know Wind. But what is your name?"*

The same evening, they sat in Wind’s room, 
the eGull simulator on a large screen.

Wind grinned: “Sorry, it's not the real eGull, 
and it's ancient — it’s like three years old.”

He put on the headset — 
“Hey Dragon, can you teach Sophie to fly?”

“Of course, Wind.”, the Dragon’s voice answered.

"Welcome Sophie. Let's begin with level flight."

The next evening, dragon's voice now familiar: 
"Let's practice turns at minimum airspeed." 

She entered a slow turn to the left, 
trying to fly as slow as she could. 

"Sophie, you are flying too slow."


The horizon tilted. The stall warning beeped.
The dragon's voice, calm but firm: "I have control."

But Sophie's hands stayed frozen on the stick, knuckles white.

"Let go!" Wind said urgently. "Dragon needs to fly!"

The beeping grew louder. The horizon spun. 
Sophie pulled harder, trying to fix it.

Everything rotated backwards now, faster and faster.
The dragon's voice, still calm but urgent: 
"Sophie, push the stick forward. Now."

The little eGull spiraled down, spinning, until—
The screen went black.  
Silence.

The scene changed again. The eGull, now broken, 
hung in the treetops of a steep hill.

"What have you done to my dragon?", Wind teased.

"Sophie, we are going to learn stalls, but not today," Dragon said. 

"Let's try again. 
And learn to fly together and transfer control," Dragon added.

Next attempt. Same slow flight turn to the left. Same warning beep.

"Sophie, you are flying too slow."

The dragon's voice: "I have control."

This time, Sophie's hand relaxed on the stick, 
"You have the control".

The horizon steadied. The beeping stopped.
The valley returned, peaceful and level.


"Good," Dragon said. "We are at the level flight again. 
You can have the control."

Sophie took the stick again, lighter this time.
"I have control... What if I mess up again?"
"Then you will say three words: 'You have control.' And I will fly."

"Always?"

"Almost always. Sometimes I may need your help."  Dragon said.

They were getting the hang of it and practicing landings. 
One time, it was looking good on a glide to land.
Finally, she thought that she had it this time, 
ready to land — 

Sophie closed her eyes for a moment — 
a quick wish for luck — 
like many people do when landing.

The plane drifted off the centerline, 
and she couldn't quite get it back.

She had to abort the approach,
and do it all over again.

The Dragon spoke gently:  
“Sophie, a perfect landing is like catching a ball.  

Imagine you play catch with Wind.  
You throw the ball—  
and instead of playing,  
he closes his eyes.  

Would he catch the ball?”  

Sophie sighed, “No, of course not.”  

She tried it again. And again.
And again.

And in time, she could land the little eGull,
gently, on the centerline, every time.

The days flew by, and soon it was Christmas.

Winter camp was fun — music, games, laughter.
Sophie felt light and happy.

But Christmas Day was different.  
The day was just starting in California, 
but when she called her family, it was 
already evening in Paris.

They had planned to fly, but Mom asked her  
to go to church first. By the time they came back,  
the weather turned restless. Gusts picked up.
Flying lessons were canceled.  

They went home, disappointed.

On Sunday, Wind’s dad bought tickets for a sailing trip, 
they drove over the hills to the ocean.
The air smelled of salt and sunlight, 
and soon they were aboard a white catamaran.

On Sundays in winter Paris, decorations, candles, and  
hymns were the highlight of the season. 
But here, she leaned on the forward rail beside Wind, 
hair flying, spray on her cheeks.

Sophie grinned, “This is almost like flying,” she said.

Wind laughed. “Almost.”

Wind’s dad smiled. 
“You kids are right in your elements,” 
he said,
“I’ve always loved the water and the wind. 
That’s how Wind got his name.”

The New Year came, and camp started again 
after the Christmas break. During the holidays she 
had flown several times in a real airplane, 
with an instructor. Her training progressed. 

She kept her eyes open, 
steady on the controls, 
flying with precision.

And one morning, Wind told her she was ready.
Ready for the real eGull.

Wind’s voice crackled over the radio 
from the grass beside the taxiway:  
“Nice and slow, okay?”  

The dragon’s voice followed, 
warm and deliberate:  
“Today we will learn to taxi.”  

She didn't get to fly, 
but she got to control a real airplane.

Somewhere over the ocean,

The dragon’s voice, calm and deliberate:  
“Let’s begin with level flight.”

Outside her window, 
an impossibly high white cloud drifted 
in the shape of a luminous seagull.
