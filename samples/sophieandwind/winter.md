Sophie and Winter

Sophie standing at the rail of a bench in the Luxembourg Gardens in winter. Bare trees, pale sky, her scarf lifted by a breeze. The Eiffel Tower faint in the background. She looks toward the distance as if imagining someplace far away.

One gray afternoon, Sophie’s mother smiled at her over the kitchen table.  
“How would you like to go to Winter Camp in California?  
It’s at Wind’s school.”  

Sophie’s spoon stopped halfway to her mouth.  
“Really?”  
“Really.”

At the airport, her dad hugged her tight.  
“Sophie, be gentle with Wind, he loves you,” he said. 
“And come back in one piece.”

Her brother grinned and parroted, “Be gentle with Wind, no biting…” — rubbing his arm.  
She had bitten her brother once, when she was six, and neither of them had ever forgotten it.  

“I still can’t believe Mom and Dad are letting you go overseas alone,” he added.  

Dad laughed. “She’s ready. And the world’s ready for her.”

Airport departure hall, winter light through tall glass. Sophie stands with her small suitcase, her dad’s arm around her shoulders. Her brother relaxed, preppy, next to her mom, one hand rubbing his arm. Mom's hair is dark brown, brother in late tweens. Behind them, travelers move toward the security queue; Bashful Lamb peeks from the side pocket of Sophie’s bag.

In the Waymo, Wind typed on the screen: “Sunnyvale.”  

Sophie snorted. “That’s not a real place.”

“It’s real. We’re in Silicon Valley — this is where your iPhone was created. We’ll even drive past Apple today.”

He leaned back, grinning. “And my home here is a Hidden Silicon Valley inside Silicon Valley. Used to be a sand mine. They filled it in, built houses about fifty years ago.”

Sophie snorted. “That's definitely not a real place.”

Wind laughed. “It is as real as Jardin du Luxembourg,” you'll see.

The Waymo eased forward, merging into the stream of cars, then slid toward the airport exit.

Wind’s townhouse looked bigger on the inside. Light poured in from skylights and wide windows.  
The living room ceiling rose so high it felt like a hall.  

Sophie sank into a golden-yellow sofa, the travel catching up to her.  
Her eyes were already closing when Wind’s dad clapped his hands.  
“No sleeping now! Go to the pool, get some air.”  

Ten minutes later they were splashing in the turquoise water.

After the swim, they rode to the ice cream shop.  
The bike lane curved past quiet houses, flowers spilling over fences, and an orange tree heavy with fruit.  
Sophie rang her bell at a green *Route 600* sign and laughed when Wind tried to race her to the corner.

Two kids on bikes in a Bay Area neighborhood — Sophie’s lime-green bike with a small rear basket, Wind’s bright orange bike with a silver bell.  
A painted bicycle lane runs along the street.  
Low houses with gardens, flowering bushes, and one orange tree glowing in the afternoon sun, oranges hanging heavy on the branches.

On Sunday, Wind’s dad bought tickets for a sailing trip, 
they drove over the hills to the ocean.
The air smelled of salt and sunlight, 
and soon they were aboard a white catamaran.

Sophie and Wind leaned on the forward rail, 
hair flying in the wind, spray on their cheeks.

Wind’s dad smiled. “You kids are right in your elements,” he called.
“I’ve always loved the water and the wind. That’s how Wind got his name.”

The next day, Wind took Sophie to his school, for a winter camp.
It was a small bilingual school, with a big courtyard and around sixty kids at the camp.
Sophie felt shy at first, but kids were friendly to a newcomer from Paris.
They played games, made art, it was fun.

@right: page, text
And then, the next day, Wind told her a secret.

“There’s something I can do here that I can’t do in Paris,” Wind said.  

“In Paris, to fly an airplane, you need to be fifteen years old.  
But here…”

That afternoon, after camp, Wind led Sophie past the hangars at the airport. The air smelled of sun-warmed asphalt and avgas.

“Wait — you can fly an airplane?” Sophie stared at him.  

“Yeah. I’ve been flying since I was eight,” Wind said. “Here, I can.”  

She looked at the little silver eGull. “It’s so small. Where do I sit?”  

Wind grinned. “You don’t. It’s only got one seat.”  

“One seat? That’s not fair. You can't take me?”

"How can I learn to fly it?” Sophie asked, eyes bright. 
"Can I get in?"

“Sure — but it’s tied down. There'll be no flying today.”  

They squeezed in together in the single seat, side by side.


@right: page, image, portrait-oriented
View from behind the open cockpit of a small single-seat ultralight eGull, tied down on a sunny ramp.  
Inside, Sophie (10, sun-touched light brown hair in a loose ponytail, wearing a sleeveless cream top) and Wind (10, tousled blond hair, blue t-shirt) are squeezed together on a single, narrow bench seat, knees and hips touching.  
No visible gap between them — the seat is one continuous cushion, with a single backrest, barely wide enough for two kids.  
On the glareshield, a small HUD-style projector casts a shimmering gold-and-silver dragon in the air above the instruments, translucent and alive.  
Sophie leans forward slightly, looking at the dragon projection; Wind’s head tilts toward her as if sharing the moment.  
Through the canopy, a bright winter sky and a distant hangar are visible.

“The golden lines shifted, forming eyes that turned toward her.”
“It’s looking at me.”  

Wind smiled. “It’s a dragon. Here, put on the headset.”  

Through the soft hiss of the headset, a warm, deliberate voice:  
*"Hello. I know Wind. But what is your name?"*

He puts on the headset: “Hey Dragon, remember me? It’s Wind.”  
Bashful Lamb sits on the bed in the background.

Sophie in the pilot chair. Two monitors show the eGull's panel instruments; a projection on the wall glows with a sunny valley.
The dragon's voice fills the headset, warm and deliberate:
"Let's begin with level flight."

Wind sits beside her, watching.

sim_crash: page, text, centered

The next evening, dragon's voice now familiar: "Let's practice turns at minimum airspeed."
She trimmed the eGull and entered a slow turn to the left, her lips tight, trying to fly as slow as she could.
"Sophie, you are flying too slow."
The horizon tilted. The stall warning beeped.
The dragon's voice, calm but firm: "I have control."
But Sophie's hands stayed frozen on the stick, knuckles white.
"Let go!" Wind said urgently. "Dragon needs to fly!"
The beeping grew louder. The horizon spun. Sophie pulled harder, trying to fix it.
Everything was rotating backwards now, faster and faster.
The dragon's voice, still calm but urgent: "Sophie, push the stick forward. Now."
But her hands wouldn't move. The little eGull spiraled down, spinning, until—
The screen went black.
Silence.
The scene on the screen changed to eGull, now broken stuck, on top of the trees of a steep hill.
"What have you done to my dragon?", Wind teased.
"Sophie, we are going to learn stalls, but not today," Dragon said. "Today is for learning to turn level, at minimum airspeed, constant bank, and in balance."
--
sim_dragon_save: page, text, centered

Next attempt. Same slow flight turn to the left. Same warning beep.
"Sophie, you are flying too slow."
The dragon's voice: "I have control."
This time, Sophie's hand relaxed on the stick, "You have the control".
On the screen, ghostly dragon wings overlaid the eGull. The horizon steadied. The beeping stopped.
The valley returned, peaceful and level.
"Good," Dragon said. "We are at the level flight again. You can have the control."
Sophie took the stick again, lighter this time.
"What if I mess up again?"
"Then you will say three words: 'You have control.' And I will fly."
"Always?"
"Almost always. Sometimes I may need your help."  Dragon said.
Wind smiled.

The next afternoon, Sophie sat in the real eGull, headset snug over her ears.  
Wind’s voice crackled over the radio from the grass beside the taxiway:  
“Nice and slow, okay?”  

The dragon’s voice followed, warm and deliberate:  
“Today we will learn to taxi. Use gentle pedal pressure.”  

Sophie felt the sunlight on her shoulder and the gentle rumble of the wheels beneath her feet.

On her last night, the clubhouse glowed with string lights.  
A few camp friends came to say goodbye.  
There was music, paper lanterns, and a table piled high with cupcakes and cookies.  

After the party, Sophie and Wind sat on the low deck steps.
They kissed, unabashed and certain, knowing tomorrow won't be here.

@right: page, image
The next morning at the airport, they sat side by side, watching planes taxi past.  

Two weeks of winter holidays with Wind had flown by like two years… or like one day.  
And then it was time to go back, into the winter in Paris, without Wind.  

“You can come any time, you know,” Wind said.  

“Just say the word.”  

Sophie smiled through the tears. “You’ll hear it.”

Who am I?  

I stand so cold, but wind  
still finds me,  
melting frost where dreams unwind me.  

Over the waves I drift and glide,  
with stitched-soft heart and wings stretched wide.  
I wait where clouds and silence meet—  
till tickles warm the bashful feet.  

I am a healer, a keeper of skies,  
a shadow in stone with bright-open eyes.  
I am a voice when the path runs blind,  
the spark in the code you leave behind.  

Deep in the trees I stand so wide,  
roofs drinking light on the sunlit side.  
Wind lives in me, gentle and kind—  
lighting lights as the dark unwinds.  

When you know me, you’ll understand—  
I'm with the sun across the land.  
And days are best— when the sky is wide,  
with me and friends flying by your side.  

                        The Dragon.

Somewhere over the ocean, Sophie closed her eyes.  
The airplane hummed, the seatbelt pressed warm against her.  
And in the quiet, she could almost hear the headset again—  

The dragon’s voice, calm and deliberate:  
“Let’s begin with level flight.”

Outside her window, an impossibly high white cloud drifted in the shape of a luminous seagull.

On the flight home, a toddler in the seat next to her looked shy, with the eyes kept drifting to Bashful Lamb in her backpack.

Sophie smiled, — “Would you like it?” she asked.

The baby nodded. She passed the lamb, and baby's fingers curled around the soft toy.  
By the time the plane started to move, the baby was fast asleep, Bashful Lamb in her arms.

March 2029.  

Somewhere over the Atlantic, on a flight to Paris,  
Wind sat by the window, sunlight catching the edge of a folded newspaper.  

The headline read:  
**Bashful Lamb gets back from retirement**  

The company credited “an outpouring of letters from young fans” for reviving the toy,  
with one particularly touching story about a lamb that flew around the world  
after being given away to another child on an overseas flight.  

Wind smiled to himself and kept reading.

He’s holding a half-folded newspaper; the front page visible to the reader shows  
the *Bashful Lamb gets back from retirement* headline and first paragraph.  
A laptop rests on his tray table, half-open, with a small **wind.dev** sticker on the lid.  
Outside the window: high clouds over the ocean.  
A faint reflection of the sunlight on the glass outlines his face.
