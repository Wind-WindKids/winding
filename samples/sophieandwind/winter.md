Sophie and Winter

It was winter, and Wind was away.  
Every winter, he left Paris for the other side of the world.

One gray afternoon, Sophie’s mother smiled at her over the kitchen table.  
“How would you like to go to Winter Camp in California?  
It’s at Wind’s school.”  

Sophie’s spoon stopped halfway to her mouth.  
“Really?”  
“Really.”

The next month, Sophie packed her small suitcase.
She was going to San Francisco, to see Wind.
She folded her clothes neatly, took a few books, a few chocolate bars,
and her favorite toy that she had since she was a baby — Bashful Lamb.

Her dad drove them to the airport, with her brother in the backseat, teasing her about Wind the whole way.

At the airport, her dad hugged her tight.  
“Sophie, be gentle with Wind, he loves you,” he said. 
“And come back in one piece.”

Her brother grinned and parroted, “Be gentle with Wind, no biting…” — rubbing his arm.  

“I still can’t believe Mom and Dad are letting you go overseas alone,” he added.  

Dad laughed. “She’s ready. And the world’s ready for her.”

Her brother relaxed, preppy, next to her mom, one hand rubbing his arm. Mom's hair is dark brown, brother in late tweens. Behind them, travelers move toward the security queue; Bashful Lamb peeks from the side pocket of Sophie’s bag.

She went quickly through the security, no line, no waiting.
Sophie felt a little nervous, it went so fast, and she was alone now.

The flight was the longest and most boring she had ever taken.
But she had a chat with a lady sitting next to her, who was very nice.
And she watched cartoons, read, and slept a little.

She texted Wind as soon as she landed:
*I’m here!*

She felt a little nervous, but also excited.

And she got a reply almost right away:
*I’m here too!*  
*See you soon!*

When she stepped out of the plane, the air smelled different, warm. 
And in another half an hour, there was Wind, grinning at her.

Wind called a car from his phone and inside typed on the screen: “Sunnyvale.”  

Sophie snorted. “That’s not a real place.”

Wind laughed. “It is as real as Eden, or Luxembourg,” you'll see.

The car eased forward, merging into the stream of cars, then slid toward the airport exit.

Wind’s townhouse looked bigger on the inside. 
Light poured in from skylights and wide windows.  
The living room ceiling rose so high it felt like a hall.  

Sophie sank into a golden-yellow sofa, the travel catching up to her.  
“No sleeping now! Let's go to the pool, get some air.”  

Five minutes later they were splashing in the turquoise water.
After the swim, they rode their bikes to the ice cream shop,
at a small pedestrian square, full of restaurants and cafes.

On Sunday, Wind’s dad bought tickets for a sailing trip, 
they drove over the hills to the ocean.
The air smelled of salt and sunlight, 
and soon they were aboard a white catamaran.

Sophie and Wind leaned on the forward rail, 
hair flying in the wind, spray on their cheeks.

Wind’s dad smiled. “You kids are right in your elements,” he called.
“I’ve always loved the water and the wind. That’s how Wind got his name.”

Sophie grinned, “This is almost like flying,” she said.

Wind laughed. “Almost.”

The next day, Wind took Sophie to his school, for a winter camp.
It was a small bilingual school, with a big courtyard and around sixty kids at the camp.
Sophie felt shy at first, but kids were friendly to a newcomer from Paris.
They played games, made art, it was fun.

@image:
The courtyard of a school. Children playing, Sophie and Wind among them. A few trees, a low building with large windows, and bright blue sky overhead.

And then, the next day, Wind told her a secret.

“I can fly, here, in California. I have a real airplane.”

Sophie looked at him, puzzled. “What do you mean? How can you have an airplane?”

"It's not possible in Paris, but here, in California, rules are not the same," he said, grinning,  “It’s an ultralight, an eGull, and there’s no restrictions for kids to fly it, rules are this way."

That afternoon, after camp, Wind led Sophie past the hangars at the airport. The air smelled of sun-warmed asphalt and oil.

“Wait — it's yours? You really can fly an airplane?” Sophie stared at him.  

“Yeah. I’ve been flying since I was eight,” Wind said. “Here, I can.”  

She looked at the little white eGull. “It’s so small. Where do I sit?”  

Wind grinned. “You don’t. It’s only got one seat.”  

“One seat? That’s not fair. You can't take me?”

“No passengers, I'm not allowed,” Wind said, sadly.
“So if you want to fly with me, you have to learn.”  
“Okay, I want to learn!” Sophie replied eagerly.

"How can I learn to fly it?” Sophie asked, eyes bright. 
"Can I get in?"

“Sure — but it’s tied down. There'll be no flying today.”  

And we'll need to close the canopy, if you want to see everything.
The eGull was a single-seater, but it was designed for an adult,
so they squeezed together in the cockpit, and Wind closed the canopy.

Wind switched on the instruments, and the screen in the center lit up.

On the canopy, a shimmering shape of lines appeared, forming a tiny golden dragon.
Sophie stared, her eyes wide. And the golden lines shifted, dragon eyes looked at her.

“It’s looking at me.”  

Wind smiled. “It’s a dragon. Here, put on the headset.”  

Through the soft hiss of the headset, a warm, deliberate voice:  
*"Hello. I know Wind. But what is your name?"*

The same evening, they sat in Wind’s room, the eGull simulator on a large screen.

Wind grinned: “Sorry, it's not the real eGull, and it's ancient — it’s like three years old.”
He puts on the headset: “Hey Dragon, can you teach Sophie to fly?”

“Of course, Wind.”, the Dragon’s voice answered.

Sophie sat in the chair, putting on the headset.
The dragon's voice filled the headset, warm and deliberate:

"Welcome Sophie. Let's begin with level flight."

Wind sat beside her, watching.

The next evening, dragon's voice now familiar: "Let's practice turns at minimum airspeed."

She trimmed the eGull and entered a slow turn to the left, 
her lips tight, trying to fly as slow as she could.

"Sophie, you are flying too slow."

The horizon tilted. The stall warning beeped.
The dragon's voice, calm but firm: "I have control."

But Sophie's hands stayed frozen on the stick, knuckles white.

"Let go!" Wind said urgently. "Dragon needs to fly!"

The beeping grew louder. The horizon spun. Sophie pulled harder, trying to fix it.

Everything was rotating backwards now, faster and faster.
The dragon's voice, still calm but urgent: "Sophie, push the stick forward. Now."
But her hands wouldn't move. The little eGull spiraled down, spinning, until—
The screen went black.
Silence.
The scene on the screen changed. The eGull, now broken, hung in the treetops of a steep hill.

"What have you done to my dragon?", Wind teased.

"Sophie, we are going to learn stalls, but not today," Dragon said. 
"Today is for learning to turn level, at minimum airspeed, constant bank, and in balance."

Next attempt. Same slow flight turn to the left. Same warning beep.
"Sophie, you are flying too slow."
The dragon's voice: "I have control."
This time, Sophie's hand relaxed on the stick, "You have the control".
On the screen, ghostly dragon wings overlaid the eGull. The horizon steadied. The beeping stopped.
The valley returned, peaceful and level.
"Good," Dragon said. "We are at the level flight again. You can have the control."
Sophie took the stick again, lighter this time.
"What if I mess up again?"
"Then you will say three words: 'You have control.' And I will fly."
"Always?"
"Almost always. Sometimes I may need your help."  Dragon said.
Wind smiled.

The next afternoon, Sophie sat in the real eGull, headset snug over her ears.  
Wind’s voice crackled over the radio from the grass beside the taxiway:  
“Nice and slow, okay?”  

The dragon’s voice followed, warm and deliberate:  
“Today we will learn to taxi. Use gentle pedal pressure.”  

Sophie felt the sunlight on her shoulder and the gentle rumble of the wheels.
She didn't get to fly, but she was allowed to control a real airplane.

On her last night, the clubhouse glowed with string lights.  
A few camp friends came to say goodbye.  
There was music, paper lanterns, and a table piled high with cupcakes and cookies.  

After the party, Sophie and Wind sat on the low deck steps.
They kissed, knowing tomorrow won't be here.

The next morning at the airport, they had to say goodbye.

Two weeks of winter holidays with Wind had flown by like two years… or like one day.  
And then it was time to go back, into the winter in Paris, without Wind.

Somewhere over the ocean, Sophie closed her eyes.  
The airplane hummed, and she could almost hear the headset again —  

The dragon’s voice, calm and deliberate:  
“Let’s begin with level flight.”

Outside her window, an impossibly high white cloud drifted in the shape of a luminous seagull.

Who am I?  

I stand so cold, but wind  
still finds me,  
melting frost where dreams unwind me.  

Over the waves I drift and glide,  
with stitched-soft heart and wings stretched wide.  
I wait where clouds and silence meet—  
till tickles warm the bashful feet.  

I am a healer, a keeper of skies,  
a shadow in stone with bright-open eyes.  
I am a voice when the path runs blind,  
the spark in the code you leave behind.  

Deep in the trees I stand so wide,  
roofs drinking light on the sunlit side.  
Wind lives in me, gentle and kind—  
lighting lights as the dark unwinds.  

When you know me, you’ll understand—  
I'm with the sun across the land.  
And days are best— when the sky is wide,  
with me and friends flying by your side.  

                        The Dragon.
