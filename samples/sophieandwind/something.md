Short version: it starts with a **concussion** and **broken rib** and **loss-of-control shock** that gets **pattern-matched** a second time, right as **puberty “weather”** arrives. That trio flips her nervous system from seek/play to **freeze/avoid**.

### Beat-by-beat from your pages

1. **Shock & helplessness (the seed)**
   *“She looked away… the world went sideways… Blood on her helmet… lifted her away… **Without him.**”*
   → Acute scare + separation + concussion + injury; her brain tags “being taken over” as danger.

2. **Re-exposure of the same pattern (the spark)**
   Crosswind takeoff: *“**I’m taking control now.**”*
   → The Dragon’s takeover echoes the helicopter’s takeover. Same felt shape: she’s no longer in control.

3. **Affect shift / irritability (the snap)**
   *“Stop saying that! I know how to fly level!”*
   → Defensive edge; pushback at the voice that once felt safe.

4. **Meaning-making that locks it in (the loop)**
   Journal focuses only on worst memories → *“she was done with Wind.”*
   → Avoidance gives relief ⇒ the freeze response is reinforced.

5. **Physiological/narrative confirmation (the state)**
   Retreat to quiet spaces; boundary hardens (*“Don’t touch me.”*); later **numbness** at her parents’ hug.
   → Your epilogue sums it: *“Something had happened to her… Something no one could see.”*

6. **Background “weather”**
   Puberty arrives on top of all this—*no one’s fault*—which intensifies the freeze and the need for distance.

That’s the origin: **accident and injury → felt helplessness → mirrored by Dragon takeover → defensive snap → negative journaling → avoidance/numbness**, under a normal developmental shift.
