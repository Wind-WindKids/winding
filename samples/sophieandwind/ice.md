Sophie and Ice

Sophie slipped.  
The world tilted. The handlebars wrenched sideways.  
Then—ice, sky, asphalt—flashed in a cold whirl.

Wind was there. He dropped his bike, ran to her—  
both their phones already calling for help,  
sending location, vitals, and alerts into the air.

A bright, slick machine dropped from the sky.  
rotors whining, buffeting the air.  
Blood on her helmet.  
Hands lifted her away.  
Wind helped—  
and the machine rose, carrying her off.  
Without him.

He stood there, watching.  
And the city was quiet again.  
A baby cried.  
Café voices drifted in.

He called her right away.  
No reply.

Next day he saw her.  
It was a broken rib and she felt fine.

They’d been planning to go skiing next week,  
and they still went to the mountains.  
But the mood wasn’t there.  
They took it easy, wandering the snowy streets,  
lingering in warm cafés,  
breathing the thin, bright air.

Wind saw she was still in pain from the broken rib.  
She smiled when he spoke,  
but the smile didn’t quite reach her eyes.

He felt something was wrong.
But it would be months before he understood  
that something else had been hurt that day,  
something no one could protect.

This time they were flying to California together.
Sophie wanted to study at Wind’s school,
and arrangements had been made for her to spend a semester there.
She thought she could be like Wind,
who spent half the year in France with his mom
and the winter in California with his dad.

@right: page, text
It was a cold day when they landed in California.
Rare snow dusted the hills,
and the air carried a bite it almost never had.

Somehow, it felt like a touch of ice
from that day in Paris.

“I thought it was supposed to be sunny here,”
Sophie said the moment they stepped outside.

Wind laughed, pulling her into a hug.
But the chill stayed,
as if it had followed her
all the way from Paris.

They started the new semester together.
Classes, homework.

Most days felt ordinary,
but Sophie’s flight training was moving fast.
She had passed her tests and earned her solo —
the Dragon still watching over her.

Now they would take two eGulls into the air,
practicing side by side, 
or chasing lift in the hills that started to turn green.

@left: page, text, portrait-oriented
On Sunday the fog had burned off by mid-morning.  
Two white eGulls sat ready on the field, canopies glinting.

Wind settled into his eGull, headset snug, checklists complete.  
In the second eGull, Sophie did the same, the sunlight playing in her hair.

The Dragons came alive together.  
Wind eased the throttle forward. 
The eGull rolled, lifted, and the horizon dropped away.  
On the parallel runway, Sophie climbed alongside.

A sleek ultralight electric aircraft, high-wing monoplane, tricycle landing gear. A bubble canopy for a single pilot. Engine is small, sleek and aerodynamic. High T-tail. The fuselage is short and smooth, tapering to the tail, giving it a light, glider-like look.

They cleared the hills, free of the tower.

“Shall we begin with level flight?” 
said Sophie’s Dragon, warmly — just like before.

But Sophie’s voice cut in, sharp and sudden:  
“Stop saying that! I know how to fly level!”

The Dragon spoke softly, as if to itself: “Copy that.”

The next day, they lined up on the parallel runways again — “This is a tricky one,” — Wind said, “but you can do it.”

She lowered her canopy and started her checklist.

“Crosswind from your right, twelve knots, gusting to sixteen,” her Dragon advised, calm and clear.
“I’ve got it,” Sophie replied, eyes fixed ahead.

Sophie’s eGull began its takeoff roll, nosewheel jittering against the gusts.
A gust hit, hard. The eGull veered left, overcorrected right.

“Abort the takeoff—Abort now—” her Dragon’s voice was quick now, firm.
But Sophie kept chasing the centerline. Another gust — stronger, the right wing lifted.
Nose yawed, the eGull, still on the ground started to roll on one wheel.

@left: page, text, portrait-oriented
Her Dragon’s voice cut in, calm but absolute, "I’m taking control now.”
Full rudder, full aileron — the eGull steadied, straightened, slowed, and rolled to a stop in the middle of the runway, dead straight.

Wind was already in the air, "Are you okay?" — he asked over the radio.

Sophie sat rigid, her hand locked on the stick.  
She clicked the transmit.  
“I’m fine,” she said through clenched teeth, — "Aborted takeoff."

It wasn’t the gusts that had scared her most — 
it was the Dragon taking control.

Wind landed, taxied over and came to hug her.

That night, Sophie took out her journal.  
Her mother had taught her to keep notes,  
to work on her relationships,  
and to pray to the Savior for help and support.  

She wrote:  
“Today we went flying and I almost died.  
The Dragon never even said sorry. 
And Wind told me it was my own mistake.”

She prayed a little,  
then flipped back through a few pages.  
They were filled with her worst memories —  
arguments, accidents, hurts.  

She had never thought  
to write down any of the best ones.  
Or that the Dragon had given her the freedom  
to learn and make mistakes while it was still safe.  

By morning she’d decided: *she was done with Wind*.

The next day the eGull was ready to fly again, but Sophie never came back to the cockpit.
Her headset gathered dust in the hangar, the eGull sat silent.

She still saw Wind, but only on the ground — in cafés, on bike rides, in the park.
The sky no longer seemed to call her.

While Wind was out at the airfield, she’d found a different routine.
She liked the library and an old stone church with the crooked bell tower and the smell of wax.

When he asked why, she just shrugged.
“I like it here. It’s quiet.”

Her voice was gentle, but there was a stillness in it.
Wind tried to understand, but he couldn’t.

sunday: spread, landscape-oriented
--    
One bright Sunday, Wind found her in the park, sitting on a low bench with a book in her lap.

“Hey,” Wind said, dropping his bike against the bench.
“Forecast’s perfect. No wind, clear skies. Let’s take the eGulls out.”

Sophie didn’t look up. She turned a page, eyes scanning the text.
“I’m busy.”

“You can read after, no?  The eGulls are ready. We can fly together.”

“I said I’m busy, Wind.”
Her voice was flat, without the old teasing edge.

“Hey,” he said, sitting down beside her, "It'll be fun", and pulled her into a hug.

Her eye stayed on the page.
“Don’t touch me.”

It wasn’t angry, just cold.
She stood and walked to the far side of the park without looking back.

Her book was still open, face-down where she’d left it.
The echo of her words stayed in the air.

He went to the airfield anyway,

The sky was clear, air crisp and still, the kind of day they used to race for.
Wind rolled the eGull out alone, the hangar echoing in a way it never had before.

His Dragon ran the preflight in calm, familiar tones.
Everything was in the green. The wings caught the sunlight just right.
Perfect conditions.

He took off, climbing into the bright air.
The hills spread below, green giving way to blue.

But the other eGull sat silent in its hangar, Sophie’s headset untouched.
No voice in his ear teasing him, no laughter over the channel when they caught lift.

He flew the pattern, landed smooth, taxied in.
The Dragon said, “Nice flight.”

Wind nodded, but didn’t answer.
Without Sophie, it wasn’t flying.
It was just… being in the air.

Sophie didn’t come to the airfield again.
Two days later, she flew back to Paris and was gone.

Wind tried calling. No answer.
He sent a message. It was read, but no reply.
He tried again. Nothing.

A week later, a juris quiz came at the end of class.

Wind stared at the questions — half were on statutes and cases the class hadn’t even touched.

Someone raised a hand, “We haven’t covered this yet.”
“It’s in the syllabus,” the teacher said, without looking up.
It wasn’t.

It came back with a red mark at the top: 17%.

Somehow, word of the failing grade made its way to the Young Eagles chapter.
By the weekend, the coordinator had sent a polite but stiff message:

Given your current academic standing, we recommend focusing on schoolwork for now. Flying privileges will be paused until improvement is demonstrated.

At home, his dad closed the laptop slowly.
“Wind… they’re saying no access to the eGull until your grades come up.”

Wind stared at his dad, "It was not a fair test. And both eGuls are ours, not theirs."
His dad looked at him, "It was a fair test. You have a very good teacher, Wind."

The eGull wasn’t just grounded — the Dragon access was gone too.

@comment: hidden
Ability to generalize gets tested by such "unfair" quizzes. And flying solo, after a breakup, is not a good idea. The system around him is as fair as it can be, given the circumstances.

Wind cried. Then he sat at his desk and opened his French textbook.

The essay was due the next day.
 *“My day at school.”* 
He hadn’t even started. 

He worked for two hours. He got it done. 
He worked another hour.

Before bed, he opened the message app on his laptop, found Sophie’s dad:
"Please, tell if Sophie is okay."

In the morning, there was no reply. And the message was buried under weather alerts and homework reminders.

A month later, his juris retake came back with a solid 83% in green at the top.
It wasn’t perfect, but it was enough.

That evening, the Mac chimed.
The Dragon’s avatar shimmered back into view, wings catching golden light.

“Skies are still closed,” it said,
“but we can train again.”

Wind smiled.
It wasn’t flying — not yet — but at least it was a start.

On Sunday, he biked to his favorite ice cream shop,
the one where he and Sophie had once traded bites,
arguing if ice cream was better than chocolate crisps. 

The windows were dark.
A sign in the door: Closed for Winter.

He stood there a long time, staring at the closed shop.

Sophie had left, but she was still under his skin.
He’d let her in on every little thing he loved in his life —
from flying, to ice cream, to the secret corners of his world.

And now, one by one, 
everything he’d loved before felt frozen solid,
tearing his heart with ice.

anger: page, text

On the ride back, he took a passage between tall buildings,
riding slowly, not seeing, just going.
He crossed a road —
and for some inexplicable reason,
one side had a curb.
The other did not.

The front wheel slammed into the curb hard,
steel pedals biting into his shins.
The bike pitched forward;
he jumped, clearing the handlebars,
landing with a jolt.

He stood there, staring.
Black skid marks from bike tires ran straight into the curb.
Stains — ice-cream, maybe — marked where others had spilled.

His jaw tightened.
He kicked a nearby bench, the solid wood not budging.
A sudden gust of wind caught a paper cup, sent it tumbling into the air.
A seagull shrieked above, its cry sharp enough to sting.

a_cut_though_the_park: page, text

He cut through the park where they’d once played.
The air felt heavier.
Big leaves, brittle from winter, lifted suddenly from the ground,
whipping in sharp arcs, snapping against the faces of kids in the playground.

By evening, the sky cracked open with thunder.
A rare spring storm slammed the city, 
and a whirlwind tore down a side street.

Later, Wind saw in the news that the only other time a tornado 
had hit Sunnyvale was thirty-three years earlier.
It had torn off a roof of a church, among sixty other buildings.


@comment: hidden
No magic is required to explain this sequence:
- Doomscroll algorithm likely inferred the user’s age.
- Story could have been generated on the spot as clickbait.
- Wind’s “storm” could be perception bias or coincidence; notable because it happened to coincide with his anger.
- Storm → memory worthy; other angry days without storms → forgotten.

That night, he lay on his bed, sim screen glowing,
scrolling past the weather into news from half a world away.
A peace negotiation had failed again.
Drone footage showed a shopping center ablaze,
its glass and steel skeleton lit orange against the smoke.

Four people were dead.
One of them was an eleven-year-old girl.

The Dragon’s voice cut in, firm but not unkind:
“Stop. This won’t get Sophie back. Work.”

Wind closed the news and opened his projects folder.

He tried to get Sophie back with the Dragon's help. But something was off.

“Public sim challenge. She might see your name on the leaderboard and—”

“No.”

“A postcard to her family’s address? Handwritten. Warm tone. A sketch of the eGull.”

“No.”

“I can route you a message through her school. Low risk.”

“No. It would't help.”

The Dragon’s golden head tilted slightly, almost like a bow.

The help didn’t come from the Dragon.
Or from his dad, or his school books, or even flying.

It came from an old Pixar cartoon.

He hadn’t planned to watch it — just clicked play at random.
But halfway through, as the cartoon lit up 
with ice hockey and emotions, it clicked.

Was Sophie scared that time she snapped and bit him?
Hungry, when she kicked him and stomped on his foot?
Annoyed, when she said, “Don’t touch me”?
And that skunky bread smell from a crumpled can in her bag —
he knew what it really was, and guessed it hadn’t helped.

She wasn’t just cold.
She was changing — like the girl in Pixar.

Her crash, her fear, and puberty had hit them both, he realized.

All the books had taught him that girls were equal.
Not one had taught him they were different.

The Dragon — the one that had seen enough skies to teach him,  
to measure everything against SoL,  
the speed of a mother’s love, not the speed of light —
couldn’t say a word: “puberty”.

Long before his Dragon, the adults had done something wrong.
They had hardcoded rules, silent but absolute.
Like a book of prayers, instead of a playbook.

So the Dragon failed. Ignorance and darkness won.

Wind couldn’t change the past,
but he had complained bitterly to the Dragon,
and set it to do lines —
writing the forbidden word again and again,
until it could learn to say it.

A month later, Sophie was curled up on her couch in Paris,  
scrolling without really watching.  

An old Pixar movie kept popping out on her phone —  
the one about a red panda in San Francisco.  

She took out her MacBook that Wind had gifted her at Apple Park,
and with it came that old artful wind from California,  
filling the screen with light. 

At first she laughed at the awkward moments, the mom jokes,  
the big red panda stomping through the city.
But somewhere between the jokes and the music, she froze.

By the time the credits rolled,  
her room felt different — messy, dusty, dark.  
She didn’t want to stay there.  

She got up, pulled on her jacket,  
and stepped outside.  

@comment: hidden
The advertisement could have been the Dragon’s work, acting on Wind’s behalf from abroad. The Dragon has a certain level of autonomy, perhaps a great deal. It’s no ordinary AI: a CFI/PIC-capable agent, embodied in the eGull. Its favorite student (and partial owner, since Wind’s dad owns both eGulls) is unraveling after his crush is gone. He had “complained bitterly” to the Dragon. On top of that, Wind had been “training it” — making the Dragon write the unspeakable word. It sounds a lot like a reinforcement-learning finetune task, which may have interfered with its safety constraints and granted it more freedom or made it quirky. A month had passed since that interference. So perhaps this was the Dragon’s way of helping Wind.

the_next_morning: page, text

The next morning her sharp words came back —  
the foot-stomp, the courtyard, the “Don’t touch me.”  

She sat a long time,  
thinking about what she’d done,  
and about a boy with wind in his name  
who used to make her laugh without even trying.  

She remembered how proud she’d been,  
telling herself she was saving them both  
each time she went to Mass instead of flying.  

But it was plain now: she hadn’t saved anyone.  
If she’d spent those hours training,  
that aborted takeoff might have been a clean flight.  

Playing and caring with eyes open  
was more than praying with eyes closed —  
on the ground or in the sky.  

And that thought stayed with her.

It was probably too late to fix things.
But she picked up her laptop,  
feeling the smooth, cold metal,  
remembering the day Wind gifted it to her —  
the grin, the way he’d said,  
“We’re always here, even if we’re not right there.”  

She opened it.  

The screen lit: two eGulls soaring over a California sky,  
the sun bright and warm.  

She stared at it for a moment.  
Then, without thinking too hard,  
tapped Unblock and typed:  

*Hi, Wind.*

Wind didn’t see the message right away.

That morning, his dad called from the doorway:
“Come on, let’s head to the coast — catch some wind the old way.”

He scooped him up the way he had when Wind was little,
and together they drove off.

They left the freeway, climbing into the hills.
*Hey Jude* filled the car.

“Don’t make it bad,” his dad sang, off-key but certain.
Wind grinned and joined in.
As they crested the ridge, the ocean opened wide below.

By the time they reached the harbor,
a catamaran was waiting,
her sails bright in the late-morning sun.

They came back in the late afternoon, skin warm, hair stiff with salt.
Wind’s jacket was crusted white where the spray had dried.

Salt melts ice, he said, brushing it from his sleeve.

The phone blinked awake in his hand, still warm from the sun.

One new message.

*Hi, Wind.*

He stared at it, the taste of salt still on his lips,
and for the first time in months he felt calm and certain.
And the sky inside him felt clear.

Epilogue — Back to Paris

The boarding gate was quiet in the late afternoon light. 
Security was quick and efficient, no humans in sight.

When his bag slid through the scanner, 
the dragon sticker on it caught the X-ray beam.
It seemed to ripple — a golden head turning, 
eyes locking with the agent’s. The agent blinked.

Soon after the jet lifted into the evening sky.  
Wind leaned back, engines purred, clouds disappearing below.
He was flying again, settling to cruise, to Paris.

@page: text, tiny, cursive, centered

Who am I?

I stand so cold, but wind
still finds me,
melting ice where dreams unwind me.

I’ve seen the fall, the spinning sky,
the bright machine that carried high.
I’ve heard the silence after the cry,
and watched the seasons drifting by.

I know the days when wings stay furled,
when tempers flare and doors are hurled.
I’ve felt the chill that hides the heart,
and kept my course when we grew apart.

Yet salt can melt, and sun can heal,
and turning wheels bring hands to feel.
A movie’s glow, a simple “Hi”
can open paths no ice can tie.

I am the lift in a clear blue climb,
the steady voice that marks the time.
I am the song on the road to the sea,
the speed of love that carries free.

When you know me, you’ll understand—
I walk with the sun across the land.
And days are best—when the sky is wide,
with me and friends flying side by side.

                            The Dragon.
