Sophie slipped.  
The world tilted. The handlebars wrenched sideways.  
Then—ice, sky, asphalt—flashed in a cold whirl.

Wind was there. He dropped his bike, ran to her—  
both their phones already calling for help,  
sending location, vitals, and alerts into the air.

A bright, slick machine dropped from the sky.  
rotors whining, buffeting the air.  
Blood on her helmet.  
Hands lifted her away.  
Wind helped—  
and the machine rose, carrying her off.  
Without him.

He stood there, watching.  
And the city was quiet again.  
A baby cried.  
Café voices drifted in.

He called her right away.  
No reply.

Next day he saw her.  
It was a broken rib and she felt fine.

They’d been planning to go skiing next week,  
and they still went to the mountains.  
But the mood wasn’t there.  
They took it easy, wandering the snowy streets,  
lingering in warm cafés,  
breathing the thin, bright air.

Wind saw she was still in pain from the broken rib.  
She smiled when he spoke,  
but the smile didn’t quite reach her eyes.

He had to come back to school, holidays were over. 
But they agreed to meet in California soon,
where she'd be staying with his family for a while.

But he felt something was wrong.
It would be months before he understood  
that something else had been hurt that day,  
something no one could protect.

It was a cold day when he arrived in California that winter.  
Rare snow dusted the hills,  
and the air carried a bite it almost never had.

Somehow, it felt like a touch of ice  
from that day in Paris.

And that cold spell came back a few weeks later.

“I thought it was supposed to be sunny here,”  
Sophie said the moment she saw him at the airport.

Wind laughed, pulling her into a hug.  
But the chill stayed,  
as if it had followed her  
all the way from Paris.

They came back to the usual routine. 
School, homework, flying adventures.

Fog

@left: page, text, portrait-oriented
On Sunday the fog had burned off by mid-morning.  
Two white eGulls sat ready on the field, canopies glinting.

Wind settled into his cockpit, headset snug, checklists complete.  
Across the tarmac, Sophie adjusted her seat, the sunlight playing in her hair.

The Dragons came alive together.  
Wind eased the throttle forward. 
The eGull rolled, lifted, and the horizon dropped away.  
On the parallel runway, Sophie climbed alongside.

They cleared the hills, free of the tower.

“Shall we begin with level flight?” 
said Sophie’s Dragon, warmly — just like before.

But Sophie’s voice cut in, sharp and sudden:  
“Stop saying that! I know how to fly level!”

The Dragon spoke softly, as if to itself: “Copy that.”

Wind pretended to check his airspeed,  
but the knot in his stomach had nothing to do with flying.

Wind watched Sophie strap in across the tarmac.
She didn’t ask for help, didn’t look over — just lowered her canopy and started her checklist.

“Crosswind from your right, twelve knots, gusting to sixteen,” her Dragon advised, calm and clear.
“I’ve got it,” Sophie replied, eyes fixed ahead.

Wind’s own Dragon murmured in his ear: “This is a tricky one. She should wait.”

Sophie’s eGull began its takeoff roll, nosewheel jittering against the gusts.
Quater waydown the runway a gust hit, hard. The eGull veered left, overcorrected right.

“Abort the takeoff—Abort now—” her Dragon’s voice was quick now, firm.
But Sophie kept chasing the centerline. Another gust — stronger, the right wing lifted high.
Nose yawed, the eGull, still on the ground started to spin, 

Her Dragon’s voice cut in, calm but absolute.  
Full rudder, full aileron — the eGull rolled on one wheel, wings balancing, then steadied.  
It straightened, slowed, and rolled to a stop in the middle of the runway, dead straight.

Wind was already shutting down, getting unstrapped.

Sophie sat rigid, her hand locked on the stick.  
She clicked the transmit.  
“I’m fine,” she said through clenched teeth. 

She got really scared.

The next day the eGull was ready to fly again, but Sophie never came back to the cockpit.
Her headset gathered dust in the hangar, the eGull sat silent.

She still saw Wind, but only on the ground — in cafés, on bike rides, in the park.
The sky no longer seemed to call her.

While Wind was out at the airfield, she’d found a different routine.
She liked the library and an old stone church with the crooked bell tower and the smell of wax.

When he asked why, she just shrugged.
“I like it here. It’s quiet.”

Her voice was gentle, but there was a stillness in it.
Wind tried to understand, but he couldn’t.

sunday: spread, landscape-oriented
--    
One bright Sunday, Wind found her in the park, sitting on a low bench with a book in her lap.

“Hey,” Wind said, dropping his bike against the bench.
“Forecast’s perfect. No wind, clear skies. Let’s take the eGulls out.”

Sophie didn’t look up. She turned a page, eyes scanning the text.
“I’m busy.”

“You can read after, no?  The eGulls are ready. We can fly together.”

“I said I’m busy, Wind.”
Her voice was flat, without the old teasing edge.

“Hey,” he said, sitting down beside her, "It'll be fun", and pulled her into a hug.

Her eye stayed on the page.
“Don’t touch me.”

It wasn’t angry, just cold.
She stood and walked to the far side of the park without looking back.

Wind sat there, his mind blank, the echo of her words hanging in the air.

--

He went to the airfield anyway,

The sky was clear, air crisp and still, the kind of day they used to race for.
Wind rolled the eGull out alone, the hangar echoing in a way it never had before.

His Dragon ran the preflight in calm, familiar tones.
Everything was in the green. The wings caught the sunlight just right.
Perfect conditions.

He took off, climbing into the bright air.
The hills spread below, green giving way to blue.

But the other eGull sat silent in its hangar, Sophie’s headset untouched.
No voice in his ear teasing him, no laughter over the channel when they caught a thermal.

He flew the pattern, landed smooth, taxied in.
The Dragon said, “Nice flight.”

Wind nodded, but didn’t answer.
Without Sophie, it wasn’t flying.
It was just… being in the air.

Sophie didn’t come to the airfield again.
Two days later, she flew back to Paris and was gone.

Wind tried calling. No answer.
He sent a message. It was read, but no reply.
He tried again. Nothing.

Two days later, a juris quiz came at the end of class.

Wind stared at the questions — half were on statutes and cases the class hadn’t even touched.

Someone raised a hand, “We haven’t covered this yet.”
“It’s in the syllabus,” the teacher said, without looking up.
It wasn’t.

It came back with a red mark at the top: 18%.

Somehow, word of the failing grade made its way to the Young Eagles chapter.
By the weekend, the coordinator had sent a polite but stiff message:

Given your current academic standing, we recommend focusing on schoolwork for now. Flying privileges will be paused until improvement is demonstrated.

At home, his dad closed the laptop slowly.
“Wind… they’re saying no access to the eGull until your grades come up.”

Wind stared at his dad, "It was not a fair test. And both eGuls are ours, not theirs."
His dad looked at him, "It was a fair test. You have a very good teacher, Wind."

The eGull wasn’t just grounded — the Dragon access was gone too.

Wind cried. Then he sat at his desk and opened his French textbook.
Essay on "my day at school" was due the next day, and he hadn’t even started.

He worked for two hours. He got it done. He worked another hour.

Before bed, he opened the message app on his laptop, found Sophie’s dad:
"Please, tell if Sophie is okay."

In the morning, there was no reply. And the message was buried under weather alerts and homework reminders.

A month later, his juris retake came back with a solid 84% in green at the top.
It wasn’t perfect, but it was enough.

That evening, the Mac chimed.
The Dragon’s avatar shimmered back into view, wings catching golden light.

“Skies are still closed,” it said,
“but we can train again.”

Wind smiled.
It wasn’t flying — not yet — but at least it was a start.

On Saturday, he biked to his favorite ice cream shop,
the one where he and Sophie had once traded bites,
arguing over which flavor was best.

The windows were dark.
A sign in the door: Closed for Winter.

He stood there a long time, staring at the closed shop.

Sophie had left, but she was still under his skin.
He’d let her in on every little thing he loved in his life —
from flying, to ice cream, to the secret corners of his world.

And now, one by one, 
everything he’d loved before felt frozen solid,
tearing his heart with ice.


--
anger: page, text

On the ride back, he took a passage between tall buildings,
riding slowly, not seeing, just going.
He crossed a road —
and for some inexplicable reason,
one side had a curb.
The other did not.

The front wheel slammed into the curb hard,
steel pedals biting into his shins.
The bike pitched forward;
he jumped, clearing the handlebars,
landing with a jolt.

He stood there, staring.
Black skid marks from bike tires ran straight into the curb.
Stains — ice-cream, maybe — marked where others had spilled.

His jaw tightened.
He kicked a nearby bench, the solid wood not budging.
A sudden gust of wind caught a paper cup, sent it tumbling into the air.
A seagull shrieked above, its cry sharp enough to sting.

a_cut_though_the_park: page, text

He cut through the park where they’d once played.
The air felt heavier.
Big leaves, brittle from winter, lifted suddenly from the ground,
whipping in sharp arcs, snapping against the faces of kids in the playground.

By evening, the sky cracked open with thunder.
A rare spring storm slammed the city, and an unheard-of whirlwind tore down a side street,
shattering windows and ripping a chunk from the roof of an old building.

Later, Wind found in the news that the only other time a tornado had hit Sunnyvale
was thirty-three years earlier, in May 1998 — tearing the roof off a church and damaging sixty homes.

@comment: hidden
No magic is required to explain this sequence:
- Doomscroll algorithm likely inferred the user’s age.
- Story could have been generated on the spot as clickbait.
- Wind’s “storm” could be perception bias or coincidence; notable because it happened to coincide with his anger.
- Storm → memory worthy; other angry days without storms → forgotten.

That evening, he lay on his bed, phone in hand,
thumb drifting past weather reports into headlines from half a world away.
A peace negotiation had failed again.
Drone footage showed a shopping center ablaze,
its glass and steel skeleton lit orange against the smoke.

Four people were dead.
One of them was an eleven-year-old girl.

The Dragon’s voice cut in, firm but not unkind:
“Stop procrastinating. This will not get Sophie back.
Get to work.”

Wind set the phone down and opened his projects folder.

He tried to solve it with the Dragon's help. But something was off.

“Public sim challenge. She might see your name on the leaderboard and—”

“No.”

“A postcard to her family’s address? Handwritten. Warm tone. A sketch of the eGull.”

“No.”

“I can route you a message through her school. Low risk.”

“No. It would't help.”

The Dragon’s golden head tilted slightly, almost like a bow.

The Dragon — the one that had seen enough skies to teach him to measure everything against SoL,
the speed of a mother’s love, not the speed of light —
couldn’t say a word about puberty.

Sometime, long before his dragon, the adults had done something wrong.
They’d hardcoded rules, silent but absolute: don’t speak of this.

And so, ignorance and darkness won.

The Dragon failed.

pixar: page, text

The help didn’t come from the Dragon.
Or from his dad, his school books, or even flying.

It came from an old Pixar movie.

He hadn’t planned to watch it — just something to fill a rainy evening.
But halfway through, as the cartoon lit up with swirls of color and emotion, it clicked.

Was Sophie scared that time she’d snapped at him?
Hungry when she’d hit him and stepped on his foot?
And that skunky bread smell from a crumpled can he’d once noticed in her bag.
He knew what it really was, and he had guessed it really didn't help.

She wasn’t just cold.
She was changing — like the girl in Pixar.

Her crash, getting scared, and puberty hit them, he realized.

All the books taught him that girls were equal, 
not one taught that they were different.

He couldn’t change the past, but he had complained bitterly to the Dragon.

A month later, Sophie was curled up on her couch in Paris,  
scrolling without really watching.  

An old Pixar movie kept popping out on her phone —  
the one about a red panda in San Francisco.  

She took out her MacBook that Wind had gifted her at Apple Park,
and with it came that old artful wind from California,  
filling the screen with light. 

At first she laughed at the awkward moments, the mom jokes,  
the big red panda stomping through the city.
But somewhere between the jokes and the music, she froze.

By the time the credits rolled,  
her room felt different — messy, dusty, dark.  
She didn’t want to stay there.  

She got up, pulled on her jacket,  
and stepped outside.  

@comment: hidden
The advertisement could have been the Dragon’s work, acting on Wind’s behalf from abroad. The Dragon has a certain level of autonomy, perhaps a great deal. It’s no ordinary AI: a CFI/PIC-capable agent, embodied in the eGull. Its favorite student (and partial owner, since Wind’s dad owns both eGulls) is unraveling after his crush is gone. He had “complained bitterly” to the Dragon. On top of that, Wind had been “training it” — making the Dragon write the unspeakable word. It sounds a lot like a reinforcement-learning finetune task, which may have interfered with its safety constraints and granted it more freedom or made it quirky. A month had passed since that interference. So perhaps this was the Dragon’s way of helping Wind.



@right: text
The next morning her sharp words came back to her —  
the foot-stomp, the courtyard, the “Don’t touch me.”  

She sat there a long time,  
thinking about what she’d done,  
and about a boy with wind in his name  
who used to make her laugh without even trying.  

She also thought of how proud she’d been,  
telling herself she was the one saving them both 
each time she went to Mass instead of flying.

She picked up her laptop,  
feeling the smooth, cold metal,  
remembering the day he’d given it to her —  
the grin, the way he’d said,  
“We’re always here, even if we’re not right there.”  

She opened it.  

The screen lit: two eGulls soaring over a California sky,  
the sun bright and warm.  

She stared at it for a moment.  
Then, without thinking too hard,  
tapped Unblock and typed:  

*Hi, Wind.*

@comment: hidden
They don’t need mediation or saviors — if the historical Jesus were dropped into this setting, he’d probably rage at the idea that children like Sophie and Wind are being told they’re not enough, that they must submit to something else to be “saved.”

Wind didn’t see the message right away.

That morning, his dad had called from the doorway,
“Come on, let’s head to the coast — catch some wind the old way.”

He picked him up, like he used to and gently tossed him into the back seat of the car.
They rolled out of town, climbing into the hills where the winter grass shimmered silver in the sunlight.

Hey Jude filled the car.

“Don’t make it bad,” his dad sang, off-key but certain.
Wind grinned and joined in, the chorus swelling as they crested the ridge,
the ocean opening wide below them.

By the time they reached the harbor, the catamaran was ready,
her sails bright in the late-morning sun.

They came back in the late afternoon, skin warm, hair stiff with salt.
Wind’s jacket was crusted white where the spray had dried.

Salt melts ice, he said, brushing it from his sleeve.

The phone blinked awake in his hand, still warm from the sun.

One new message.

*Hi, Wind.*

He stared at it, the taste of salt still on his lips,
and for the first time in months he felt calm and certain.
And the sky inside him felt clear.

Epilogue — Flight

The boarding gate was quiet in the late afternoon light. 
Security was quick and efficient, no humans in sight.

When his bag slid through the scanner, 
the dragon sticker on the lid caught the X-ray light.
The sticker seemed to ripple — a golden head turning, 
eyes locking with the agent’s. The agent blinked.

Soon after the jet lifted into the evening sky.  
Wind leaned back as the Bay fell away below.  
Engines purred, clouds disappearing below.
He was flying again, settling to cruise, to Paris.

scenes_dragon_whiteboard: page, portrait-oriented, image

@image:
A sleek golden Dragon stands in front of a tall whiteboard. One wing is folded, the other used for balance as it grips a green marker in its claw. The board is filled with messy, half-tilted handwriting — the same sentence written over and over:

> I can say a word puberty.
> I can say a word pubuty.
> I can say a word
> I can say a word puberty.
> I can say a word pubety.
> I can say a word puberty.
> I can say a word puburty.
> I can say a word puberty.
> ....
> I can say a word preme—

Some lines miss *puberty* entirely. Some have it misspelled. One has it crossed out.

The Dragon is mid-sentence, tongue slightly out in concentration, as if drilling a phrase it was never supposed to be able to say.

Dragon: “Today we are going to study ice in flight.  
And ice in flight is bad news.”  

Wind: “But I don’t need bad news. I want good news.”  

Dragon: “Statistically, if you want good news, you should ditch Sophie.”  

Wind: “Wait… what?”  

Dragon: “When ice is encountered, the rule is simple:  
immediately start working to get out of it.  
No panic. No delay. But no waiting, either.”  

Wind: “You’re talking about wings.”  

Dragon: “I’m talking about Sophie.  
She iced half your world.  
Safe pilots exit the cloud. They don’t cling to it.  
You’d be better off finding a copilot, not a cloud.”  

Wind: “I can move a cloud or two.”  


Dragon: “Clouds don’t move with the wind, remember?  
They move with the fronts.  
They are bound to terrain.”  

Wind: “Touché. But I love clouds. They’re fluffy.”  

Dragon: “Along a cold front, fluffy clouds make freezing rain.  
Deadly.”  

Wind: “I’m not afraid. I can write with clouds in the sky!”  

Dragon: “Brave. But unsafe.  
At least get equipped for flight into icing conditions.”  

Wind: “With what? Combat pillows? Iron safety boots?”  

Dragon: “No. Boundaries.  
Procedures.  
The things you follow even when you’d rather not.”  

Wind: “Yeah… not my style.”

“You failed!?”  
Sophie’s voice cut sharper than the clink of cups below.

“You — Wind — failed a grade school quiz?  
And they grounded you for months?”

Wind shrugged, tracing a circle in the condensation on his glass.  

“And half the questions weren’t even in the book. That’s so unfair,” she said.

“He’s a very good teacher,” Wind replied.

Sophie blinked.  
“Wait… what?”

They were sitting at the upper level of a small Parisian café,  
the kind of place where local tweens ordered citron pressé  
and felt very grown up.


She straightened a little, and said with pride.  
“In my school, teachers always cover the test material.  
Always. That’s what makes them good.”  

Wind traced another circle in the glass.  
“When I was training my Dragon, I learned something else.”  

Sophie blinked again.  
“You can train your Dragon?”

Wind nodded.  
“You’d give it something to learn, but the quiz needs to be different.  
Like… you train it to write one word on a whiteboard,  
and then you ask for another.”  

Sophie frowned, remembering.  
“Like words it couldn’t say?”  

Wind gave a small smile.  
“Exactly.”

Sophie sat cross-legged on her bed, laptop open.  
The Dragon’s golden head shimmered on the screen, waiting.  

“Why do you always start with level flight?” she asked.  
“Every single time. It’s boring.”  

The Dragon tilted its head.  
“It is a joke. And not a joke.”  

Sophie raised an eyebrow.  
“That makes no sense.”  

The Dragon’s wingtip tapped the screen.  
A digital book floated up — *Jonathan Livingston Seagull*.  

Sophie leaned closer.  
“You’re telling me to read a book about a bird?
That makes even less sense.”

The Dragon’s eyes glowed.  
“It may, once you read it.”

Sophie laughed, half annoyed, half intrigued.  
“Fine. I’ll read your bird book.  
But next time — no level flight.
How about a barrel roll?
Can I train you to always start with a barrel roll?”

Who am I?

I stand so cold, but wind
still finds me,
melting ice where dreams unwind me.

I’ve seen the fall, the spinning sky,
the bright machine that carried high.
I’ve heard the silence after the cry,
and watched the seasons drifting by.

I know the days when wings stay furled,
when tempers flare and doors are hurled.
I’ve felt the chill that hides the heart,
and kept my course when we grew apart.

Yet salt can melt, and sun can heal,
and turning wheels bring hands to feel.
A movie’s glow, a simple “Hi”
can open paths no ice can tie.

I am the lift in a clear blue climb,
the steady voice that marks the time.
I am the song on the road to the sea,
the speed of love that carries free.

When you know me, you’ll understand—
I walk with the sun across the land.
And days are best—when the sky is wide,
with me and friends flying side by side.

                            The Dragon.

The generative AI art in *Sophie and Ice* is not without flaws. If you'd like to illuminate your own version, please visit [wind.kids](https://wind.kids).

Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the many magnificent ones—large and small—who have opened access to their models, technologies, and the modern digital art workshop: a true bicycle-for-the-mind. Without these tools, Sophie and Ice would never have fit within the constraints of everyday life, and simply wouldn’t have been possible.

What began as a bike is now almost a fusion-powered flying dragon for the mind.

With deep gratitude to the creators, scientists, engineers, artists, and dreamers who share their knowledge and imagination with the world. This story was shaped by light and darkness, life, love and the love of life and light.

The author works at one of the labs where pieces of modern-day magic quietly come together. An active pilot in the past, he still flies some times and finds inspiration in art, flight, technology, and the creative threads that connect them.
