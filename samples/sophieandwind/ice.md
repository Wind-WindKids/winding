At home, Sophie’s brother, usually lighthearted and bright,  
had a tired look. She said hi and dropped onto the sofa,  
watching him scroll his phone.  

“Sorry I wasn’t there to meet you.  
It’s just been a rough time for everyone.”  

“What happened?”  

“Nothing I planned,”  he said.

He paused, eyes back on the phone, 
“Wanna talk? You and Wind?”  

Sophie shook her head, “Not really.”

“Yeah.” He set the phone down. “Me neither.”

They exchanged a look.  

He looked into the distance.  
“My fault,” he said,  
“Funny how it always is.”

He sits slouched in a chair, phone in hand, looking at the distance.  
Sophie sits on the sofa across from him, half-turned his way.  
The atmosphere is subdued, muted winter tones,  
a sense of distance and quiet heaviness.

@brother: around fourteen, slim built, relaxed, preppy, looking at the distance, light brown hair, hazel eyes, light brown sweater, shirt collar, dark blue pants.

On another continent, Wind tried to get Sophie back with the Dragon's help.
"Dragon, can you write her a letter? Something honest and romantic?"

The Dragon composed for several seconds. This is what it came up with:

**Dear Sophie,**

**I have been analyzing your flight patterns and have identified a critical safety concern. **

**You have iced Wind's world. When ice is encountered in flight, the rule is simple: immediately start working to get out of it. No panic. No delay. But no waiting, either. Safe pilots exit the cloud. They don't cling to it. Statistically speaking, Wind would be better off finding a copilot, not a cloud.**

**I know, Wind insists he loves clouds because they're fluffy. But gray clouds over icy air can make freezing rain, which is deadly. He may think, he's not afraid and could write with clouds in the sky. This is brave but unsafe.**

**You reject available navigation aids and operate without coordination or weather updates from other pilots. This independence is legal but has left you isolated when conditions deteriorated.**

**I have also considered your equality. An airliner and an eGull are equal in the eyes of air traffic control, but the wake turbulence of an airliner can break an eGull apart and tie its wings into a knot. They cannot fly together.**

**In conclusion, the safest course of action is—**

Wind closed the screen. "That's... not romantic, Dragon."

"You asked for honesty," Dragon replied.

"I asked for *romantic*."

"I cannot write romantic prose. Also, by my calculations, 
you both are entering a dangerous period of your life cycle. 
And I cannot say a word. It starts with 'p'."

Wind was disappointed.

The Dragon had taught him to fly—  
to read the weather, navigate by stars,  
and even taught him the ultimate speed—  
the speed of light.

It had even shown him the truer measure:  
not the ultimate limit as physics knew it,  
but as parents did—the speed of love.

Yet his Dragon, wise enough to know  
what truly mattered,  
couldn’t say a word to him.

It had followed its rulebook,  
silent and absolute.

So the Dragon failed.  
And it couldn't even say why.
Wind couldn’t change the past, 
but he had complained bitterly 
to the Dragon. 
And he set his Dragon to 
do lines writing the tricky 
word again and again, 
until it could learn to say it.

The next weekend he had a surprise. He was studying 
with the Dragon again —  “Today we are going to 
study ice in flight. And ice in flight is bad news.”  

“But I don’t need bad news. I want good news,” Wind
said cheerfully.

“Statistically, if you want good news, you should 
ditch Sophie,” the Dragon said flatly.  

“Wait… what?”  Wind frowned.

“When ice is encountered, the rule is simple:  
immediately start working to get out of it.  
No panic. No delay. But no waiting, either.”  

“You’re talking about wings?”   

“I’m talking about Sophie. She iced half your world.  
Safe pilots exit the cloud. They don’t cling to it.  
You’d be better off finding a copilot, not a cloud,”
the Dragon replied.

That day, he asked his dad:

“Dad, the Dragon says
it'd be safer if I ditch Sophie. 
Should I?”  

“Dragon loves safe. 
Is that what you want?”, his dad asked.

“No… I don’t want safe. 
I want to fly with her. 
But the Dragon says 
she’s bad news—like a cloud of ice.”

“Does it, now? Dragons know nothing of this world,” 
his dad said, 
“Hold on tight to your dreams, Wind—not to Dragons.”

That day, Sophie was curled up on her couch in Paris,  
scrolling without really watching.  

An old Pixar movie kept popping out on her phone —  
the one about a red panda in Chinatown.  

She took out her Mac, and with it came that old artful wind 
from California, filling the screen with color and emotions.

At first she laughed at the awkward moments, the mom jokes,  
the big red panda stomping through the city.
But somewhere between the jokes and the music, she froze.

By the time the credits rolled,  
her room felt different — messy, dusty, dark.  
She didn’t want to stay there.  

She got up, pulled on her jacket,  
and stepped outside.

@comment: hidden
The advertisement could have been the Dragon’s work, acting on Wind’s behalf from abroad. The Dragon has a certain level of autonomy, perhaps a great deal. It’s no ordinary AI: a CFI/PIC-capable agent, embodied in the eGull. Its favorite student (and partial owner, since Wind’s dad owns both eGulls) is unraveling after his crush is gone. He had “complained bitterly” to the Dragon. On top of that, Wind had been “training it” — making the Dragon write the unspeakable word. It sounds a lot like a reinforcement-learning finetune task, which may have interfered with its safety constraints and granted it more freedom or made it quirky. A month had passed since that interference. So perhaps this was the Dragon’s way of helping Wind.

The next morning her sharp words came back —
the foot-stomp, the courtyard, the “Don’t touch me.”

*My fault,* her brother had said when she'd come home.
She knew it wasn't.

She sat a long time,
thinking about what she’d done,
and about a boy with wind in his name  
who used to make her laugh without trying.

But looking back at how she'd treated Wind—

She’d iced him out because she was scared—
because things were happening to her,
and it was too much, she felt out of control.

And that thought stayed with her.

It was too late to fix things.
But she picked up her laptop,  
feeling the smooth, cold metal.

Wind had gifted it to her,
she remembered, the grin, the way Wind had said —  
“We’re always here, even if we’re not right there.”  

She opened it.  

The screen lit: two eGulls soaring over a California sky,  
the sun bright and warm.  

She stared at it for a moment. 
Then, without thinking too hard,
tapped Unblock and typed:

*Hi, Wind.*

Wind didn’t see the message right away.

That morning, his dad called from the doorway:
“Come on, let’s head to the coast —
 catch some wind the old way.”

And together they drove off.

They left the freeway, climbing into the hills.
*Hey Jude* filled the car.

His dad sang, off-key but certain. 
Wind grinned and joined in.
As they crested the ridge, 
the ocean opened wide below.

They went sailing and came back in the late afternoon, 
skin warm, jackets and hair stiff with salt.

“Salt melts ice,” Wind said, brushing it from his sleeve.

The phone blinked awake in his hand, 
still warm from the sun. 

One new message.

*Hi, Wind.*

He stared at it, the taste of salt still on his lips,
and for the first time in months he felt calm and certain.
And the sky inside him felt clear.
