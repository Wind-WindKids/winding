At home, Sophie’s brother, usually lighthearted and bright,  
had a tired look. She said hi and dropped onto the sofa,  
watching him scroll his phone.  

“Sorry I wasn’t there to meet you.  
It’s just been a rough time for everyone.”  

“What happened?”  

“Nothing I planned,”  he said.

He paused, eyes back on the phone, 
“Wanna talk? You and Wind?”  

Sophie shook her head, “Not really.”

“Yeah.” He set the phone down. “Me neither.”

They exchanged a look.  

He looked into the distance.  
“My fault,” he said,  
“Funny how it always is.”

He sits slouched in a chair, phone in hand, looking at the distance.  
Sophie sits on the sofa across from him, half-turned his way.  
The atmosphere is subdued, muted winter tones,  
a sense of distance and quiet heaviness.

@brother: around fourteen, slim built, relaxed, preppy, looking at the distance, light brown hair, hazel eyes, light brown sweater, shirt collar, dark blue pants.

A week later, on another continent,  
it was a civics class for Wind.
A quiz came at the end of class. 
Wind stared at the questions. 

Someone raised a hand, 
“We haven’t covered this yet.”

“It’s in the syllabus, 
between lines twelve and thirteen,” 
the teacher said, without looking up.

It wasn’t.

It came back with a red mark at the top: 17%.

Somehow, word of the failing grade 
made its way to the flying club.
By the weekend, the coordinator 
had sent a polite but stiff message:

> Given your current academic standing, 
> we recommend focusing on schoolwork for now. 
> Flying privileges will be paused 
> until improvement is demonstrated.


At home, his dad closed the laptop slowly.
“Wind… they’re saying no access to the 
eGull until your grades come up.”

Wind stared at his dad, "It wasn't a fair test. 
And both eGulls are ours, not theirs."

His dad looked at him, "It was a fair test. 
You have a very good teacher, Wind. 
Give it some time — you'll see."

The eGull wasn’t just grounded —
the Dragon access was gone too.

Ability to generalize gets tested by such "unfair" quizzes. And flying solo, after a breakup, is not a good idea. The system around him is relatively fair.

Wind cried. Then he sat at his desk 
and opened his French textbook.

The essay was due the next day.
 *“My day at school.”* 
He hadn’t even started. 

The day was a nightmare, he thought.  
No way.  
But he had to write something.

He described the most boring day in a classroom —  
silent students, the clock refusing to move.  
Only at the end did the perspective flip:  
a new class of students came in,  
and it became clear that “my” day 
had been the teacher’s all along.

It took him an hour, but it got done.  
He spent another hour to polish it.  
It wouldn’t win him an A,  
but it was enough to pass.  

Before bed, he opened the message app, 
found Sophie’s dad: 
"Please, tell if Sophie is okay."

In the morning, there was no reply. 
And the message was buried under 
weather alerts and homework reminders. 

He sighed, closed the app, 
and got ready for school.

A month later, his civics retake came back 
with a solid 83% in green at the top.

This time he had seen some pattern:
  Everyone is equal under the law.  
  Everyone is under the law.  
  Everyone is different,  
  and the laws are different  
  everywhere for everyone.  
  And that is good, sometimes.

It wasn’t perfect, but it was enough.

That evening, the Mac chimed.
The Dragon’s avatar shimmered back 
into view, wings catching golden light.

“Skies are still closed,” it said,
“but we can train again.”

Wind smiled. It wasn’t flying — not yet — 
but at least it was a start.

On Sunday, he biked to his 
favorite ice cream shop,

The windows were dark.
A sign in the door: 
*Closed for Winter.*

He stood there a long time, 
staring at the closed shop.

He let Sophie in on everything he loved.
And now, it felt frozen solid,
tearing his heart with ice.

On the ride back, he went between tall buildings,
riding slowly, not seeing, just going. He crossed a road— 
one side had a curb, the other did not.

The front wheel slammed into the curb hard,
he jumped, clearing the handlebars, landing with a jolt.

His jaw tightened. He kicked a nearby bench, 
A sudden gust of wind caught a paper cup, 
sent it tumbling into the air. A seagull shrieked far above.

looking angry, at the curb that caused his fall.

He cut through the park. The air felt heavier.

Big leaves, brittle from winter, 
lifted suddenly from the ground,
whipping in sharp arcs, snapping 
against the faces of kids in the playground.

By evening, a rare storm slammed the city, 
the sky cracked open with thunder.

@image:
Wind riding his bike through a park,
big leaves swirling in the air around him,
dark clouds gathering above,

No magic is required to explain this sequence:
- Wind’s “storm” could be perception bias or coincidence.
- Storm → memory worthy; other angry days without storms → forgotten.

He tried to get Sophie back with the Dragon's help. 
But something was off.

“Sim challenge. Your name on the leaderboard and—”

“No.”

“A postcard to her family’s address?”

“No.”

“I can route you a message through her school.”

“No. It wouldn't help.”

The Dragon’s golden head tilted slightly, 
almost like a bow.

The help didn’t come from the Dragon.
Or from his dad, or his school books, 
or even flying.

It came from 
an old Pixar 
cartoon.

He hadn’t planned to watch it — 
clicked at random.

But halfway through, as the cartoon lit up 
with ice hockey and emotions, 
it clicked.

Was Sophie scared that time she snapped at him?
Hungry, when she stomped on his foot?
Busy, when she said, “Don’t touch me”?
And he remembered her with that energy drink — 
he guessed it hadn’t helped.  

He thought she was just scared 
from the bike crash.

But it was more complicated than that.
She was changing — 
like the girl in the movie.
And in a very different way from him.

Wind was disappointed.

The Dragon had taught him to fly—  
to read the weather, navigate by stars,  
and even taught him the ultimate speed—  
the speed of light.

It had even shown him the truer measure:  
not the ultimate limit as physics knew it,  
but as parents did—the speed of love.

Yet his Dragon, wise enough to know  
what truly mattered,  
couldn’t say a word to him.

It had followed its rulebook,  
silent and absolute.

So the Dragon failed.  
And it couldn't even say why.
Wind couldn’t change the past, 
but he had complained bitterly 
to the Dragon. 
And he set his Dragon to 
do lines writing the tricky 
word again and again, 
until it could learn to say it.

The next weekend he had a surprise. He was studying 
with the Dragon again —  “Today we are going to 
study ice in flight. And ice in flight is bad news.”  

“But I don’t need bad news. I want good news,” Wind
said cheerfully.

“Statistically, if you want good news, you should 
ditch Sophie,” the Dragon said flatly.  

“Wait… what?”  Wind frowned.

“When ice is encountered, the rule is simple:  
immediately start working to get out of it.  
No panic. No delay. But no waiting, either.”  

“You’re talking about wings?”   

“I’m talking about Sophie. She iced half your world.  
Safe pilots exit the cloud. They don’t cling to it.  
You’d be better off finding a copilot, not a cloud,”
the Dragon replied.  

Wind closed the session, and rolled the training back.

That day, he asked his dad:

“Dad, the Dragon says
it'd be safer if I ditch Sophie. 
Should I?”  

“Dragon loves safe. 
Is that what you want?”, his dad asked.

“No… I don’t want safe. 
I want to fly with her. 
But the Dragon says 
she’s bad news—like a cloud of ice.”

“Does it, now? Dragons know nothing of this world,” 
his dad said, 
“Hold on tight to your dreams, Wind—not to Dragons.”

A month later, Sophie was curled up on her couch in Paris,  
scrolling without really watching.  

An old Pixar movie kept popping out on her phone —  
the one about a red panda in Chinatown.  

She took out her Mac, and with it came that old artful wind 
from California, filling the screen with color and emotions.

At first she laughed at the awkward moments, the mom jokes,  
the big red panda stomping through the city.
But somewhere between the jokes and the music, she froze.

By the time the credits rolled,  
her room felt different — messy, dusty, dark.  
She didn’t want to stay there.  

She got up, pulled on her jacket,  
and stepped outside.  

@comment: hidden
The advertisement could have been the Dragon’s work, acting on Wind’s behalf from abroad. The Dragon has a certain level of autonomy, perhaps a great deal. It’s no ordinary AI: a CFI/PIC-capable agent, embodied in the eGull. Its favorite student (and partial owner, since Wind’s dad owns both eGulls) is unraveling after his crush is gone. He had “complained bitterly” to the Dragon. On top of that, Wind had been “training it” — making the Dragon write the unspeakable word. It sounds a lot like a reinforcement-learning finetune task, which may have interfered with its safety constraints and granted it more freedom or made it quirky. A month had passed since that interference. So perhaps this was the Dragon’s way of helping Wind.

The next morning her sharp words came back —  
the foot-stomp, the courtyard, the “Don’t touch me.”  

She sat a long time,  
thinking about what she’d done,  
and about a boy with wind in his name  
who used to make her laugh without even trying.  

That she iced him out, 
simply because she was scared.

And that thought stayed with her.

It was too late to fix things.
But she picked up her laptop,  
feeling the smooth, cold metal.

Wind had gifted it to her,
she remembered, the grin, the way Wind had said —  
“We’re always here, even if we’re not right there.”  

She opened it.  

The screen lit: two eGulls soaring over a California sky,  
the sun bright and warm.  

She stared at it for a moment.  
Then, without thinking too hard,  
tapped Unblock and typed:  

*Hi, Wind.*

Wind didn’t see the message right away.

That morning, his dad called from the doorway:
“Come on, let’s head to the coast —
 catch some wind the old way.”

And together they drove off.

They left the freeway, climbing into the hills.
*Hey Jude* filled the car.

His dad sang, off-key but certain. 
Wind grinned and joined in.
As they crested the ridge, 
the ocean opened wide below.

They went sailing and came back in the late afternoon, 
skin warm, jackets and hair stiff with salt.

“Salt melts ice,” Wind said, brushing it from his sleeve.

The phone blinked awake in his hand, 
still warm from the sun. 

One new message.

*Hi, Wind.*

He stared at it, the taste of salt still on his lips,
and for the first time in months he felt calm and certain.
And the sky inside him felt clear.

He was flying again, settling to cruise — to Paris.
