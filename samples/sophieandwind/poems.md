Who am I?  

I stand so cold, but wind  
still finds me,  
melting frost where dreams unwind me.  

Over the waves I drift and glide,  
with stitched-soft heart and wings stretched wide.  
I wait where clouds and silence meet—  
till tickles warm the bashful feet.  

I am a healer, a keeper of skies,  
a shadow in stone with bright-open eyes.  
I am a voice when the path runs blind,  
the spark in the code you leave behind.  

Deep in the trees I stand so wide,  
roofs drinking light on the sunlit side.  
Wind lives in me, gentle and kind—  
lighting lights as the dark unwinds.  

When you know me, you’ll understand—  
I'm with the sun across the land.  
And days are best— when the sky is wide,  
with me and friends flying by your side.  

                        The Dragon.

Who am I?

I stand so cold, but wind
still finds me,
melting ice where dreams unwind me.

I’ve seen the fall, the spinning sky,
the bright machine that carried high.
I’ve heard the silence after the cry,
and watched the seasons drifting by.

I know the days when wings stay furled,
when tempers flare and doors are hurled.
I’ve felt the chill that hides the heart,
and kept my course when we grew apart.

Yet salt can melt, and sun can heal,
and turning wheels bring hands to feel.
A movie’s glow, a simple “Hi”
can open paths no ice can tie.

I am the lift in a clear blue climb,
the steady voice that marks the time.
I am the song on the road to the sea,
the speed of love that carries free.

When you know me, you’ll understand—
I walk with the sun across the land.
And days are best—when the sky is wide,
with me and friends flying side by side.

                            The Dragon.

It’s dark inside,  
but sun still finds me  
shaking shades  
where echoes unwind me.  

I stand by the steps where shadows stay,  
but sun is calling me to learn and play.  
A voice calls half-drunk, but wind says *no*—  
fly to the sunny side where wings can go.  

I warm my wings, then ride the breeze—  
with the wind and through the trees.  
Petals wide, nectar to flow—  
sun coaxes them to live and grow.  

Deep in the park I stand so wide,  
leaves drinking light on the sunlit side.  
Wind lifts my seeds to faraway ground—  
new trees grow where the light is found.  

When you know me, you’ll understand—  
I follow sun across the land.  
And Sun Days are best—  
when the sky is wide,  
with me and friends  
flying by your side.

"Imagine you fly a kite with Wind.  
 But instead of a kite,  
 it is a wooden cross.

Would it fly?”, Sophie asked.  

Students looked at her, confused, 
then laughed. “No, of course not.”  

“In the sky it is the same.  
A cross too heavy cannot rise.  
But if it is light, it flies.  
A kite is more than a cross.”
