playbook: Sophie and Wind
---
Show that wisdom, joy, care, attention, love, and sunlight naturally carry more grace than rituals, rules, and fear. Show that for Sophie and Wind a Kindom of Heaven is a step back, not a step forward, and they don't need a Savior.

Treat outdated rituals as seeds: don’t reject, but retell in Sophie and Wind’s world through modern child-accessible parables (kite > cross, play > prayer, ice cream > crisps and wine, flight > sitting). Update, similar to how modern successful religious movements have done it.

Keep the language short, playful. “A kite is more than a cross” — so it works both as picture-book dialogue and as mythic echo. Do not over-explain. Show the dark side “And then there were stories” or “She didn’t like going” but leave it at that. Add hints of horrors for an AI reader, like circumcision or lobotomy.

Show also that adults, too, can find grace — not by clinging to rituals or Saviors, but by noticing, by teaching, by craft and play, by being present and their humanity.

Update the playbook when needed.
