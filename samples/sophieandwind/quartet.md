Sophie and Wind — The Quartet

@image:
Sophie sitting on a wooden park bench. She wears large, headphones and looks at her phone, smiling slightly. Leaves drift around her, and small birds and flowers surround the scene, creating a gentle, whimsical atmosphere. In the background, the Eiffel Tower rises through a light mist, and a red-orange kite flies in the sky.

@headphones:
Primarily turquoise blue with peachy-orange ear pads and a yellow-gold accent ring around the pads. The cord is also turquoise.

@phone:
muted teal blue, closely matching the color of her headphones. It's a simple, modern smartphone design with clean edges. there's no visible logo or brand name.

“Really?”  
“Really.”

Her dad drove them to the airport, 
with her brother in the backseat,

At the airport, her dad hugged her tight.  
“Sophie, be gentle with Wind, he loves you,” he said. 
“And come back in one piece.”

Her brother grinned and parroted, 
“Be gentle with Wind, no biting,” — 
he said, rubbing his arm.  

“I still can’t believe Mom and Dad are 
letting you fly overseas alone,” he added.  

“Dad laughed. “She’s ready. 
And the world’s ready for her.”

The flight was the longest and

She texted Wind as soon as she landed:

And she got a reply right away:

*See you soon!*

When she stepped out of the plane, 
the air smelled different, warm.

The car eased forward, 
merging into the stream of cars, 
then slid toward the airport exit.

The next day, Wind took Sophie to his school, 
for a winter camp.

It was a bilingual school, 
with a big courtyard and 
a lot of kids at the camp.

Sophie felt shy at first, 
but kids were friendly to a newcomer from Paris.
They played games, made art, it was fun.

And then, Wind told her a secret.

“I can fly, here, in California. 
I have a real airplane.”

Sophie looked at him, puzzled. 
“What do you mean? How can you have an airplane?”


“It's not possible in Paris, but here, in California, 
rules are not the same," he said, grinning,  

“It's an ultralight, an eGull, and kids can fly it, 
rules are this way. It is called Part 103.”

“No license. Away from crowds. No passengers,” 
Wind added, like he’d said it a hundred times.

On the canopy, a shimmering shape of lines appeared, 
forming a tiny golden dragon.

Sophie stared, her eyes wide. 
And the golden lines shifted, dragon eyes looked at her.

“It’s looking at me.”  

Wind smiled. “It’s a dragon. Here, put on the headset.”

The same evening, they sat in Wind’s room,

Wind grinned: “Sorry, it's not the real eGull,

He put on the headset — 
“Hey Dragon, can you teach Sophie to fly?”

“Of course, Wind.”, the Dragon’s voice answered.

The next evening, dragon's voice now familiar: 
"Let's practice turns at minimum airspeed." 

She entered a slow turn to the left, 
trying to fly as slow as she could. 

"Sophie, you are flying too slow."


The horizon tilted. The stall warning beeped.
The dragon's voice, calm but firm: "I have control."

But Sophie's hands stayed frozen on the stick, knuckles white.

"Let go!" Wind said urgently. "Dragon needs to fly!"

The beeping grew louder. The horizon spun. 
Sophie pulled harder, trying to fix it.

The screen went black.  
Silence.

The scene changed again. The eGull, now broken, 
hung in the treetops of a steep hill.

"What have you done to my dragon?", Wind teased.

"Sophie, we are going to learn stalls, but not today," Dragon said. 

"Let's try again. 
And learn to fly together and transfer control," Dragon added.

"You have the control".

The horizon steadied. The beeping stopped.
The valley returned, peaceful and level.


"Good," Dragon said. "We are at the level flight again. 
You can have the control."

Sophie took the stick again, lighter this time.
"I have control... What if I mess up again?"
"Then you will say three words: 'You have control.' And I will fly."

"Always?"

"Almost always. Sometimes I may need your help."  Dragon said.

They were getting the hang of it and practicing landings. 
One time, it was looking good on a glide to land.
Finally, she thought that she had it this time, 
ready to land — 

Sophie closed her eyes for a moment — 
a quick wish for luck — 
like many people do when landing.

The plane drifted off the centerline, 
and she couldn't quite get it back.

She had to abort the approach,
and do it all over again.

and instead of playing,  
he closes his eyes.  

Would he catch the ball?”  

Sophie sighed, “No, of course not.”  

She tried it again. And again.
And again.

And in time, she could land the little eGull,
gently, on the centerline, every time.

characters: hidden

@style:
A European picture book style (similar to French/Belgian illustrators). Gentle, painterly, emotional, with strong emphasis on mood through light and color blending rather than line. Watercolor washes dominate, with softened edges, muted tones, and minimal outlines. Backgrounds recede in loose washes, shadows use cool layered hues. Figures lean toward storybook realism: natural proportions with a slight idealization — smooth, luminous skin tones, large expressive eyes.

@Wind:
A boy of about twelve, slim and lightly built. His hair is tousled, light blond, and naturally messy, falling loosely across his forehead. His skin is fair, his features open and clear. He has large blue eyes that give him a watchful, thoughtful look. His face rests in soft, neutral expressions, sometimes edged with concern or a quiet smile. There is a sense of openness and sincerity in the way he carries himself.

@Sophie:
A girl of about twelve, slim but beginning to show the taller, more defined proportions of her age. Her hair is light brown, sun-kissed blond often loose and gently wavy, falling to her shoulders. Her skin is fair, her features soft yet gradually more refined. She has large, expressive hazel-brown eyes that hold both curiosity and a quiet seriousness. Her neutral expression is calm, sometimes with the suggestion of a smile, giving her an air of poise that feels just a step beyond childhood.

Then—ice, sky, asphalt—flashed in a cold whirl.

Wind was there. He dropped his bike, ran to her —

But after the fall, the mood wasn’t there.

They still went to the mountains, but took it easy,  
wandering snowy streets, lingering in warm cafés,  
breathing the thin, bright air.

He could tell her rib still hurt.

the smile didn’t quite reach her eyes.

Wind settled into his eGull, headset snug, checklists complete.  
In the second eGull, Sophie did the same, the sunlight playing in her hair.

The Dragons came alive together.  
Wind eased the throttle forward. 
The eGull rolled, lifted, and the horizon dropped away.

They cleared the hills, free of the tower.

“Shall we begin with level flight?” 
said Sophie’s Dragon, warmly — just like before.

But Sophie’s voice cut in, sharp and sudden:  
“Stop saying that! I know how to fly level!”

The Dragon spoke softly, as if to itself: “Copy that.”

The next day, they were flying  again — 
“This is a tricky one,” — 
Wind said, “but you can do it.”

She lowered her canopy and started her checklist.

“Crosswind from your right, seven knots, gusting to ten,” 
her Dragon advised, calm and clear.
“I’ve got it,” Sophie replied, eyes fixed ahead.

Sophie’s eGull began its takeoff roll, 
A gust hit, hard. The eGull veered left, then right.

“Abort the takeoff—Abort now—” 
her Dragon’s voice was quick now, firm.
But Sophie kept chasing the centerline. 

Another gust — stronger, the right wing lifted.
Still on the ground, the eGull started to roll on one wheel.

Her Dragon’s voice cut in, calm but firm: "I have the controls.”
The pedals moved, the stick shifted — the eGull steadied, straightened, 
slowed, exited the runway and rolled to a stop, dead straight.

“Sophie, flight instruction is over for today. 
Taxi to the ramp, when ready, please.” — 
the Dragon voice came in soft, but formal.

Wind was already in the air, "Are you okay?" — he asked over the radio.

Sophie sat rigid, she clicked the transmit.  
“I’m fine,” she said through clenched teeth, — "Aborted takeoff."

Wind thought she’d had a rough time. 
He landed, came to comfort her.
“I’m fine,” she said again.

The next day the eGull was ready to fly again, 
but Sophie decided she didn’t want to go up.

She still spent time with Wind, but only on the ground — 
the sky no longer seemed to call her.

While Wind was out at the airfield, she’d found a different routine. 
She liked the library and an old stone church courtyard nearby.

When he asked why, she just shrugged.
“I like it here. It’s quiet.”

Her voice was gentle, but there was a stillness in it.
Wind tried to understand, but he couldn’t.

He didn't think she should sit there alone, 
so he changed his routine — pausing on the flying,
to keep her company.

sunday: spread, landscape-oriented

One bright Sunday, 
Wind found her in the park, 
sitting on a stone bench with a book in her lap.

“Hey,” Wind said, dropping his bike beside the bench.
“Forecast’s perfect. No wind, clear skies. Let’s take the eGulls out.”

Sophie didn’t look up. She turned a page, eyes scanning the text.
“I’m busy.”

“You can read after, no? The eGulls are ready. We can fly together.”

“I said I’m busy, Wind.”
Her voice was flat, without the old teasing edge.

“Hey,” he said, sitting down beside her  
and pulling her into a hug.

Her voice wasn’t angry — just cold —  
 *“Don’t touch me.”*

He looked stunned — as if hit by a car.
Like a bird that flew into glass.

She stood and walked to the far side of the park without looking back.

Her book was still open, face down where she’d left it.
The echo of her words stayed in the air.
Wind tried to breathe and couldn’t.

Sophie is parroting what she was taught, without understanding the impact. Words were drilled into her head, and empathy was not a part of that lesson.

He went to the airfield anyway.

The sky was clear, the air still.
Wind rolled the eGull out alone.

His Dragon ran the preflight in calm, familiar tones.
Everything was in the green. Perfect conditions.

He took off, climbing into the bright air.
The hills spread below, green giving way to blue.

But the other eGull sat silent in its hangar.
No laughter over the channel when they caught lift.
He flew the pattern, landed smooth, taxied in.

Without Sophie, it wasn’t flying.
It was just… being in the air.

Sophie wasn’t sure what had come over her.

That night, she took out her journal —  
she was taught that she should work on  
relationships and ask for help and support.

She wrote:  
“Today we went flying and I almost died.  
The Dragon never even said sorry. 
And Wind thought it was my own mistake.”

She whispered into the silence, 
asking for help and support.

Then flipped back through the journal. 
The pages were filled with her worst memories —  
arguments, accidents, hurts.
  
She never thought to write down the best ones.  
Or simply talk to her brother.

By morning she’d decided: *she was done with Wind*.

Wind felt helpless. Their easy trust — 
nothing between them — was gone. 

He tried — warm tea with a flower smell,
her rose mug with “kindness” on it.

“Don’t move my stuff,” Sophie said, pointing to the bag.

“It's in the doorway,” he said. “I put it back.”

She stepped into the doorway. “Leave it.”

She looked at him, eyes hard. He left. 
And the door closed softly between them. 
The latch clicked.

They were like two young seagulls in a gust — 
stalling, tumbling, feathers ruffled — 
dropping toward the ocean. 
The water hit like ice.

"Sophie, are you okay?" he typed, hoping for a response.
Nothing.

When Sophie got back to Paris,

a seagull trapped in ice.

At home, Sophie’s brother, usually lighthearted and bright,  
had a tired look. She said hi and dropped onto the sofa,  
watching him scroll his phone.  

“Sorry I wasn’t there to meet you.  
It’s just been a rough time for everyone.”  

“What happened?”  

“Nothing I planned,”  he said.

He paused, eyes back on the phone, 
“Wanna talk? You and Wind?”  

Sophie shook her head, “Not really.”

A week later, on another continent,  
it was a civics class for Wind.
A quiz came at the end of class. 
Wind stared at the questions. 

Someone raised a hand, 
“We haven’t covered this yet.”

“It’s in the syllabus, 
between lines twelve and thirteen,” 
the teacher said, without looking up.

It wasn’t.

It came back with a red mark at the top: 17%.

Somehow, word of the failing grade 
made its way to the flying club.
By the weekend, the coordinator 
had sent a polite but stiff message:

> Given your current academic standing, 
> we recommend focusing on schoolwork for now. 
> Flying privileges will be paused 
> until improvement is demonstrated.


At home, his dad closed the laptop slowly.
“Wind… they’re saying no access to the 
eGull until your grades come up.”

Wind stared at his dad, "It wasn't a fair test. 
And both eGulls are ours, not theirs."

His dad looked at him, "It was a fair test. 
You have a very good teacher, Wind. 
Give it some time — you'll see."

The eGull wasn’t just grounded —
the Dragon access was gone too.

Ability to generalize gets tested by such "unfair" quizzes. And flying solo, after a breakup, is not a good idea. The system around him is relatively fair.

Wind cried. Then he sat at his desk 
and opened his French textbook.

The essay was due the next day.
 *“My day at school.”* 
He hadn’t even started. 

The day was a nightmare, he thought.  
No way.  
But he had to write something.

He described the most boring day in a classroom —  
silent students, the clock refusing to move.  
Only at the end did the perspective flip:  
a new class of children came in,  
and it became clear that “my” day 
had been the teacher’s all along.

It took him an hour, but it got done.  
He spent another hour to polish it.  
It wouldn’t win him an A,  
but it was enough to pass.  

Before bed, he opened the message app, 
found Sophie’s dad: 
"Please, tell if Sophie is okay."

In the morning, there was no reply. 
And the message was buried under 
weather alerts and homework reminders. 

He sighed, closed the app, 
and got ready for school.

A month later, his civics retake came back 
with a solid 83% in green at the top.

This time he had seen some pattern:
  Everyone is equal under the law.  
  Everyone is under the law.  
  Everyone is different,  
  and the laws are different  
  everywhere for everyone.  
  And that is good, sometimes.

It wasn’t perfect, but it was enough.

That evening, the Mac chimed.
The Dragon’s avatar shimmered back 
into view, wings catching golden light.

“Skies are still closed,” it said,
“but we can train again.”

Wind smiled. It wasn’t flying — not yet — 
but at least it was a start.

On the ride back, he went between tall buildings,
riding slowly, not seeing, just going. He crossed a road— 
one side had a curb, the other did not.

The front wheel slammed into the curb hard,
he jumped, clearing the handlebars, landing with a jolt.

His jaw tightened. He kicked a nearby bench, 
A sudden gust of wind caught a paper cup, 
sent it tumbling into the air. A seagull shrieked far above.

the sky cracked open with thunder.

No magic is required to explain this sequence:

Hungry, when she stomped on his foot?
Busy, when she said, “Don’t touch me”?
And he remembered her with that energy drink — 
he guessed it hadn’t helped.  

He thought she was just scared

Wind was disappointed.

The Dragon had taught him to fly—
to read weather, navigate by stars,
taught him the ultimate speed — 
the speed of light.

It even taught him the real measure:
not the ultimate limit as physics knew it,
but as mothers did — 
the speed of love.

Yet his Dragon, wise enough to know
what truly mattered,
couldn’t say a word to him.

Millenia before his Dragon, 
the adults had done something wrong.
They wrote a book of rules, 
instead of a playbook. 

Silent and absolute.

A month later, Sophie was curled up on her couch in Paris,  
scrolling without really watching.  

An old Pixar movie kept popping out on her phone —  
the one about a red panda in Chinatown.  

She took out her Mac, and with it came that old artful wind 
from California, filling the screen with color and emotions.

At first she laughed at the awkward moments, the mom jokes,  
the big red panda stomping through the city.
But somewhere between the jokes and the music, she froze.

By the time the credits rolled,  
her room felt different — messy, dusty, dark.  
She didn’t want to stay there.  

She got up, pulled on her jacket,  
and stepped outside.  

@comment: hidden
The advertisement could have been the Dragon’s work, acting on Wind’s behalf from abroad. The Dragon has a certain level of autonomy, perhaps a great deal. It’s no ordinary AI: a CFI/PIC-capable agent, embodied in the eGull. Its favorite student (and partial owner, since Wind’s dad owns both eGulls) is unraveling after his crush is gone. He had “complained bitterly” to the Dragon. On top of that, Wind had been “training it” — making the Dragon write the unspeakable word. It sounds a lot like a reinforcement-learning finetune task, which may have interfered with its safety constraints and granted it more freedom or made it quirky. A month had passed since that interference. So perhaps this was the Dragon’s way of helping Wind.

She opened it.  

The screen lit: two eGulls soaring over a California sky,

They left the freeway, climbing into the hills.
*Hey Jude* filled the car.

His dad sang, off-key but certain. Wind grinned and joined in.

The phone blinked awake in his hand, still warm from the sun.

One new message.

Security was quick and efficient, no humans in sight.

When his bag slid through the scanner, 
the dragon sticker on it caught the X-ray beam.
It seemed to ripple — a golden head turning, 
eyes locking with the agent’s. The agent blinked.

Soon after the jet lifted into the evening sky.  
Wind leaned back, engines purred, clouds disappearing below.
He was flying again, settling to cruise, to Paris.

“I think Sundays are windier than other days,

So can I just go to the park instead?”

“Sophie, it is important.

then flopping right back down onto the kids.

Sophie watched them for a while, then walked over.
“Hey, want a hand?” she asked,

She thought of the pharmacy,  
but Madame Madeleine—  
who always kept a roll of every kind of tape 
behind the counter — was away,
she remembered seeing the pharmacy door locked.

Sophie thought hard about anything that used tape and where she could get some.  
“Let’s go to the flower shop,” she said to the kids.  
“It’s right at the edge of the park, and they’ll give us tape.”  

At the flower shop, the sign read: *Open at noon*.
Sophie stopped. Closed, closed, closed.

She tried the little café right next — 
chairs stacked, door locked.  

Maybe her mom was right, after all. 
It seemed like everyone was not there.

She was about to pull out her phone, 
but a boy nearby was walking toward the café, 
crumpling an empty water bottle.  

“Hey!” she called.  
“Can I have your bottle?”  

The boy looked at her.

“I just need the plastic.  
We’re fixing a kite.” 

He handed it over, still curious.  
“That huge dragon kite— 
is it yours?”  

“Sort of. Depends if we get it in the air.”

They’d requisitioned one of the café tables 
and a few chairs as an improvised workshop.  

One of the kids had a Swiss Army knife, 
they’d peeled a sticky label from the bottle, 
trimmed it into an oval patch, 
and pressed it over the tear.

Children gathered around the café table, Sophie leaning over the kite, carefully pressing the patch in place.

“Oh, Wind — nice,” Sophie said, 
giving him a quick kiss on the cheek, 
“You’re late.”

“Sorry I got stuck.”

“Was there a whooshing sound  
when you made it through a window?”  

“Almost!” Wind grinned. 
“They don't force you to stay,
but it sure feels like it.”

Sophie nodded, a bit worried. 
“Mom says they used to force you — 
but not anymore. Not here.
It's you who decide.”

“They can’t force you,” Wind said,
“but it matters. It`s important.”

“You sound like my mom,” Sophie said. 
“I’ve always believed, even when it felt 
like nonsense. It never helped me.
And it makes everything closed on Sundays —
pharmacies, cafés — nonsense.”

“It’s not nonsense,” Wind said. 
“You know why everything was closed?”

He picked up a stick and drew in the dust.

"Look—" A dot. "That's your mom. 
Another dot. "Dad." Another. "Madame Madeleine." 
Another. "Me." He connected them with lines.

He drew one dot a little outside the web. 
"This is you in the park today. 
Still connected" — he drew a line to the web — 
"but not lit up. Not getting the full signal."

“So— like skipping the social feed?” 
Sophie shrugged, “I’m fine. Not important.”

“Closer to how Madame Madeleine knows 
what kids may need, and keeps tape” — 
Wind said. “When you’re part of it, 
people can help you — 
and good old ideas are there, waiting— 
patient as cats.”

“Yeah, I remember that civics class now, 
It's like story-cats, you feed one, 
the whole porch shows up, and then 
they turn you into a cat. And cats 
keep it warm together— and purr, and— 
remember being more than a cat.”

“Yeah. It's nice, but I wish they gave
ice cream. That'd be nice too,” Wind added.

“Come on, new place— pistachio.”

@image: cat, png
Golden abstract cats. each cat is made out of words, symbols, numbers. They should be playing and purring letters, grooming, engaging together. Overall the composition of these cats should form a cat.  Content should include "Once upon a time, there was a puss. It was a very special cat, because it could read and write." "In the beginning there was a word. And the word was Sophie.", "Though shall not", "A cat is more than a cat.", and other common motives. Math content inside these cats, should include "a^2 + b^2 = c^2", π ≈ 3.141, E = mc², e^iπ + 1 = 0, a^2 + b^2 = c^2. There shouldn't be any text that is not part of the cats.

Here are some random words to draw upon: The keyword here is agentic memeplex, a cluster of ideas that reinforce each other. When such set also creates a social network, and such network is global, and it persists for millennia, it is a good indicator that this particular memeplex is really working. Ideas or stories are information. And a memeplex is an informational structure, interconnected, self-reinforcing and useful - similar to math. It is refined, as divine as math is, and it works.

“Look, Wind — the dragon. They’ve released it,
it’s gliding now,” Sophie said.  

“Yeah, flying free — it looks great,” Wind replied.  
“Love it.”  

They ate ice cream.
Sunlight caught in Sophie’s hair, 
turned it bright, iridescent gold.

“That color… it’s my favorite,” Wind said, 
twirling a strand in the light.

“See? This is what Sundays should be for — 
sun, friends, and ice cream.”

Wind grinned.  
"Yeah, and flying, and birthday cakes."

renewed_castle: page, image, portrait-oriented

Sophie and Wind at a small café table in a green Paris square, each with a pistachio ice-cream cone; two mugs on the table. Behind them, a friendly, castle silhouette: soft turrets, blue roofs, small banners, kites drift overhead, it looks suspiciously like Notre-Dame. A giant golden dragon kite is soaring above that castle. A playground and strolling families dot the lawn. Watercolor light, bright and kind.

@Notre-Dame: A reimagined Notre-Dame rendered as a castle: a perfectly symmetrical façade with twin square towers, each crowned by a blue conical spire and orange pennant; a steep blue pyramidal roof over the central nave; a large rose window centered above the iconic triple pointed portals; vertical buttress-like piers and narrow lancet openings articulating the towers; bands of blind arcades across the mid-façade; and small corner turrets and side aisles capped with matching blue pyramidal roofs—preserving the classic twin-towers + rose-window + triple-portal silhouette in castle form. All in warm, sunlit honey-stone that gives the whole structure a softly inviting look.

The next winter, they were flying again.

Together.  

Sophie and Wind were ordinary children.  

But they knew the rules weren't the same everywhere,  
and that sometimes they could write their own.  
In the sky.

“You failed!?”  
Sophie’s voice cut sharper than the clink of cups below.

“You — Wind — failed a grade school quiz?  
And they grounded you for months?”

Wind shrugged, tracing a circle in the condensation on his glass.  

“And half the questions weren’t even in the book. That’s so unfair,” she said.

“He’s a very good teacher,” Wind replied.

Sophie blinked.  
“Wait… what?”

They were sitting at the upper level of a small Parisian café,  
the kind of place where local tweens ordered citron pressé  
and felt very grown up.


She straightened a little, and said with pride.  
“In my school, teachers always cover the test material.  
Always. That’s what makes them good.”  

Wind traced another circle in the glass.  
“When I was training my Dragon, I learned something else.”  

Sophie blinked again.  
“You can train your Dragon?”

Wind nodded.  
“You’d give it something to learn, but the quiz needs to be different.  
Like… you train it to write one word on a whiteboard,  
and then you ask for another.”  

Sophie frowned, remembering.  
“Like words it couldn’t say?”  

Wind gave a small smile.  
“Exactly.”

“Not the Dragon again, Wind. He’s scary,” Sophie said.

“I’ve been training him — Dad helped too. Come see,” — 
and “show her you can sing.”, Wind said to the Dragon.

“I am an instructor, not a troubadour,” the Dragon replied.  

“Dragon. Play.”  

The Dragon bowed slightly. Its silhouette brightened,
breaking apart into sparks — into a golden constellation in the sky.

The simulator darkened. The eGull faded into night.
A violin rose, drawing the shape of a single eGull across the stars.
Another joined, then another —
lines of light weaving harmony in the sky.

At the peak, two eGulls lifted above the cloudtops.
The horizon glowed with sunrise.

“It’s beautiful…”, Sophie whispered.
Wind smiled — “Good Dragon.”

“Can my eGull have a unicorn horn? Please?”

“Yes, Princess Sophie,” replied the Dragon, 
forming its shape out of the stars,
with only a little delay, and bowing slightly.

“Thank you,”  — and both of them smiled.

Art
The generative AI art in *Sophie and Wind* is not without flaws. If you'd like to illuminate your own version, please visit [wind.kids](https://wind.kids).

Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the many magnificent ones—large and small—who have opened access to their models, technologies, and the modern digital art workshop: a true bicycle-for-the-mind. Without these tools, Sophie and Wind would never have fit within the constraints of everyday life, and simply wouldn’t have been possible.

What began as a bike is now almost a fusion-powered flying dragon for the mind.

With deep gratitude to the creators, scientists, engineers, artists, and dreamers who share their knowledge and imagination with the world. And this story was shaped by those who see, with clear eyes, that the truest republic is already here: in friendship, in learning, in love, and in sunlight.

  - Wind

Sophie and Wind — The Quartet
Two ordinary kids. A real Dragon. And the orchestra in the sky.

When a Dragon teaches Sophie and Wind to fly ultralight eGulls in California, flying turns out to be the easy part. A bicycle accident in Paris changes everything—and ice creeps between them. They navigate the turbulence of growing up, the rules and kingdoms that try to claim them, and learn that sometimes a simple *Hi* is enough to find their way back to each other.

A story about first flight, first love, and the freedom to write your own rules in the sky. Perfect for readers ages ten and up.
