Her mother paused. Sophie grinned. 

“I think Sundays are windier than other days, 
because it’s the sun that makes the wind,
and because it’s Sunday, Wind isn't at school.
So can I just go to the park instead?”

“Sophie, it is important. 
Everyone will be there.”

“I don't want to, Please?
You told me you wouldn't force me to go.”

“All right.”

“Thank you, Mom.”

Sophie watched them for a while, then walked over.
“Hey, want a hand?” she asked.

“I can see what’s off. We’ll get it fixed. 
But we do need ripstop sail tape.” she said.

@image:
Far away, in the field, two kids are arranging a large kite on a grassy field, Sophie approaching them. The kite is pale yellow, a yellow head, made out of a loose set of individual disks forming a rough shape of a dragon, with around 10 disks for each wing, 10 smaller ones for the tail, 10 for the body, It is very large, and the whole set is spread on the grass.

She thought of the workshop tools and tape—
but the workshop was at the back of the church.

And she was too embarrassed to go back there.

She thought of the pharmacy, Madame Madeleine—  
who always kept a roll of every kind of tape 
behind the counter — she was at the church.

And the little café right next— 
chairs stacked, door locked.  

Her mom was right. The adults were out.

A boy nearby was walking toward the café,

“Hey!” she called.  
“Can I have your bottle?”  

The boy looked at her.

“I just need the plastic.  
We’re fixing a kite.” 

He handed it over, still curious.  
“That huge dragon kite— 
is it yours?”  

“Sort of. Depends if we get it in the air.”

“Oh, Wind — nice,” Sophie said,

“You’re late.”

“I got stuck,” Wind replied.

“Was there a whooshing sound  
when you made it through a window?”

“Almost!” Wind grinned, 
“They have good stories— 
but the benches are very sticky,
you are fixing a kite?”

Wind looked at the patch.
“A water bottle label— 
we have proper tape at the workshop.”

“I know, but I couldn’t go after skunking out.”

“Right,” Wind said,

“It’s good enough, let’s get it up.”, Sophie said,

They launched again. It lifted, twisted— 
then flopped onto the ground with a pop.

When they've checked, the bottle label flown off.
The left wing was torn in two places.

They gathered around, inspecting the damage.
One of the kids looked close to tears.

“Can you fix it?” one of the kids asked.

Sophie studied the torn wing.
“Wind, can you get the toolbox?”

“It's there for us. You'll see.”

Sophie felt her face get hot— 
but the kids were waiting.

“Okay,” she said quietly.

They walked back to the church, then around, 
to the community space.

The church was near empty, only a few people.
Some smiled at the kids with the kite.

Sophie felt a little better.
But her Mom was not there.


They've taken the time and repaired the dragon kite,
properly this time, restoring its torn wing.

“There, good as new, it`s a great workshop,” Wind said.
the only thing missing here is ice cream. Come on. 
New place—pistachio.”

“Sophie, be gentle with Wind, he loves you,” he said. 
“And come back in one piece.”

Her brother grinned and parroted, 
“Be gentle with Wind, no biting,” — 
he said, rubbing his arm.  

“I still can’t believe Mom and Dad are

The flight was the longest and

She texted Wind as soon as she landed:

And she got a reply right away:

When she stepped out of the plane, 
the air smelled different, warm.

The car eased forward, 
merging into the stream of cars, 
then slid toward the airport exit.

The next day, Wind took Sophie to his school, 
for a winter camp.

It was a bilingual school, 
with a big courtyard and 
a lot of kids at the camp.

Sophie felt shy at first, 
but kids were friendly to a newcomer from Paris.
They played games, made art, it was fun.

And then, Wind told her a secret.

“I can fly, here, in California. 
I have a real airplane.”

Sophie looked at him, puzzled. 
“What do you mean? How can you have an airplane?”


“It's not possible in Paris, but here, in California, 
rules are not the same," he said, grinning,  

“It's an ultralight, an eGull, and kids can fly it, 
rules are this way. It is called Part 103.”

“No license. Away from crowds. No passengers,” 
Wind added, like he’d said it a hundred times.

so they squeezed in together.

On the canopy, a shimmering shape of lines appeared, 
forming a tiny golden dragon.

Sophie stared, her eyes wide. 
And the golden lines shifted, dragon eyes looked at her.

“It’s looking at me.”  

Wind smiled. “It’s a dragon. Here, put on the headset.”

“Hey Dragon, can you teach Sophie to fly?”

She entered a slow turn to the left, 
trying to fly as slow as she could. 

"Sophie, you are flying too slow."


The horizon tilted. The stall warning beeped.
The dragon's voice, calm but firm: "I have control."

But Sophie's hands stayed frozen on the stick, knuckles white.

"Let go!" Wind said urgently. "Dragon needs to fly!"

The beeping grew louder. The horizon spun. 
Sophie pulled harder, trying to fix it.

The screen went black.  
Silence.

The scene changed again. The eGull, now broken, 
hung in the treetops of a steep hill.

"What have you done to my dragon?", Wind teased.

"Sophie, we are going to learn stalls, but not today," Dragon said. 

"Let's try again. 
And learn to fly together and transfer control," Dragon added.

"You have the control".

The horizon steadied. The beeping stopped.
The valley returned, peaceful and level.


"Good," Dragon said. "We are at the level flight again. 
You can have the control."

Sophie took the stick again, lighter this time.
"I have control... What if I mess up again?"
"Then you will say three words: 'You have control.' And I will fly."

"Always?"

"Almost always. Sometimes I may need your help."  Dragon said.

They were getting the hang of it and practicing landings. 
One time, it was looking good on a glide to land.
Finally, she thought that she had it this time, 
ready to land — 

Sophie closed her eyes for a moment — 
a quick wish for luck — 
like many people do when landing.

The plane drifted off the centerline, 
and she couldn't quite get it back.

She had to abort the approach,
and do it all over again.

he closes his eyes.  

Would he catch the ball?”

Sophie slipped.  
She looked away for a moment,
and the world went sideways. 
It tilted, handlebars wrenched.
Then—ice, sky, asphalt—flashed in a cold whirl.

Wind was there. He dropped his bike, ran to her —  
called the emergency number.

A bright vehicle came quickly,
as if dropped from the sky.  

Wind helped — hands lifted her away,  
and the vehicle left, carrying her off.  
Without him.

He stood there, watching.  
And the city was quiet again.  
A baby cried.  
Café voices drifted in.

He called her right away.  
No reply.

Next day he saw her.  
It was a broken rib and she felt fine.

Wind came to Paris for Christmas break —  
they’d planned to ski.  
But after the fall, the mood wasn’t there.

They still went to the mountains, but took it easy,  
wandering snowy streets, lingering in warm cafés,  
breathing the thin, bright air.

He could tell her rib still hurt.  
She smiled when he spoke, 
but the playfulness was gone, 
the smile didn’t quite reach her eyes.

He felt something was wrong.
But it would be months before he understood
that it wasn’t only her rib that fractured,
but something unseen between them as well.

This time they were flying to California together.
Sophie wanted to study at Wind’s school,
and arrangements had been made for her 
to spend a semester there.

She thought she could be like Wind,
who spent half the year in France with his mom
and the winter in California with his dad.

It was a cold day when they landed in California.
Rare snow dusted the hills,
and the air carried a bite it almost never had.

Somehow it felt like a touch of ice
from that day in Paris.

“I thought it was supposed to be sunny here,”
Sophie said the moment they stepped outside.

Wind laughed. She did too, and they hugged.

But the chill stayed,
as if it had followed her
all the way from Paris.

They started the new semester together.
Classes, homework.

Most days felt ordinary,
but Sophie’s flight training was moving fast.
She had passed her tests and earned her solo —
the Dragon still watching over her.

Now they would take two eGulls into the air,
practicing side by side, 
or chasing lift in the hills that started to turn green.

On Sunday the fog had burned off by mid-morning.  
Two white eGulls sat ready on the field, canopies glinting.

Wind settled into his eGull, headset snug, checklists complete.  
In the second eGull, Sophie did the same, the sunlight playing in her hair.

The Dragons came alive together.  
Wind eased the throttle forward. 
The eGull rolled, lifted, and the horizon dropped away.

They cleared the hills, free of the tower.

“Shall we begin with level flight?” 
said Sophie’s Dragon, warmly — just like before.

But Sophie’s voice cut in, sharp and sudden:  
“Stop saying that! I know how to fly level!”

The Dragon spoke softly, as if to itself: “Copy that.”

The next day, they were flying  again — 
“This is a tricky one,” — 
Wind said, “but you can do it.”

She lowered her canopy and started her checklist.

“Crosswind from your right, seven knots, gusting to ten,” 
her Dragon advised, calm and clear.
“I’ve got it,” Sophie replied, eyes fixed ahead.

Sophie’s eGull began its takeoff roll, 
A gust hit, hard. The eGull veered left, then right.

“Abort the takeoff—Abort now—” 
her Dragon’s voice was quick now, firm.
But Sophie kept chasing the centerline. 

Another gust — stronger, the right wing lifted.
Still on the ground, the eGull started to roll on one wheel.

Her Dragon’s voice cut in, calm but firm: "I have the controls.”
The pedals moved, the stick shifted — the eGull steadied, straightened, 
slowed, exited the runway and rolled to a stop, dead straight.

“Sophie, flight instruction is over for today. 
Taxi to the ramp, when ready, please.” — 
the Dragon voice came in soft, but formal.

Wind was already in the air, "Are you okay?" — he asked over the radio.

Sophie sat rigid, she clicked the transmit.  
“I’m fine,” she said through clenched teeth, — "Aborted takeoff."

Wind thought she’d had a rough time. 
He landed, came to comfort her.
“I’m fine,” she said again.

Sophie wasn’t sure what had come over her.

That night, she took out her journal —  
she was taught that she should work on  
relationships and ask for help and support.

She wrote:  
“Today we went flying and I almost died.  
The Dragon never even said sorry. 
And Wind thought it was my own mistake.”

She whispered into the silence, 
asking for help and support.

Then flipped back through the journal. 
The pages were filled with her worst memories —  
arguments, accidents, hurts.
  
She never thought to write down the best ones.  
Or simply talk to her brother.

By morning she’d decided: *she was done with Wind*.

The next day the eGull was ready to fly again, 
but Sophie decided she didn’t want to go up.

She still spent time with Wind, but only on the ground — 
the sky no longer seemed to call her.

While Wind was out at the airfield, she’d found a different routine. 
She liked the library and an old stone church courtyard nearby.

When he asked why, she just shrugged.
“I like it here. It’s quiet.”

Her voice was gentle, but there was a stillness in it.
Wind tried to understand, but he couldn’t.

He didn't think she should sit there alone, 
so he changed his routine — pausing on the flying,
to keep her company.

One bright Sunday, 
Wind found her in the park, 
sitting on a stone bench with a book in her lap.

“Hey,” Wind said, dropping his bike beside the bench.
“Forecast’s perfect. No wind, clear skies. Let’s take the eGulls out.”

Sophie didn’t look up. She turned a page, eyes scanning the text.
“I’m busy.”

“You can read after, no? The eGulls are ready. We can fly together.”

“I said I’m busy, Wind.”
Her voice was flat, without the old teasing edge.

“Hey,” he said, sitting down beside her  
and pulling her into a hug.

Her voice wasn’t angry — just cold —  
 *“Don’t touch me.”*

He looked stunned — as if hit by a car.
Like a bird that flew into glass.

She stood and walked to the far side of the park without looking back.

Her book was still open, face down where she’d left it.
The echo of her words stayed in the air.
Wind tried to breathe and couldn’t.

He went to the airfield anyway.

The sky was clear, the air still.
Wind rolled the eGull out alone.

His Dragon ran the preflight in calm, familiar tones.
Everything was in the green. Perfect conditions.

He took off, climbing into the bright air.
The hills spread below, green giving way to blue.

But the other eGull sat silent in its hangar.
No laughter over the channel when they caught lift.
He flew the pattern, landed smooth, taxied in.

Without Sophie, it wasn’t flying.
It was just… being in the air.

Wind felt helpless. Their easy trust — 
nothing between them — was gone. 

He tried — warm tea with a flower smell,
her rose mug with “kindness” on it.

“Don’t move my stuff,” Sophie said, pointing to the bag.

“It's in the doorway,” he said. “I put it back.”

She stepped into the doorway. “Leave it.”

She looked at him, eyes hard. He left. 
And the door closed softly between them. 
The latch clicked.

They were like two young seagulls in a gust — 
stalling, tumbling, feathers ruffled — 
dropping toward the ocean. 
The water hit like ice.

"Sophie, are you okay?" he typed, hoping for a response.
Nothing.

a seagull trapped in ice.

“Sorry I wasn’t there to meet you.  
It’s just been a rough time for everyone.”  

“What happened?”  

“Nothing I planned,”  he said.

He paused, eyes back on the phone, 
“Wanna talk? You and Wind?”  

Sophie shook her head, “Not really.”

On another continent, Wind tried to get Sophie back with the Dragon's help.
"Dragon, can you write her a letter? Something honest and romantic?"

The Dragon composed for several seconds. This is what it came up with:


--
dragon_letter: page, text, small
--

**Dear Sophie,**

**I have been analyzing your flight patterns and have identified a critical safety concern. **

**You have iced Wind's world. When ice is encountered in flight, the rule is simple: immediately start working to get out of it. No panic. No delay. But no waiting, either. Safe pilots exit the cloud. They don't cling to it. Statistically speaking, Wind would be better off finding a copilot, not a cloud.**

**I know, Wind insists he loves clouds because they're fluffy. But gray clouds over icy air can make freezing rain, which is deadly. He may think, he's not afraid and could write with clouds in the sky. This is brave but unsafe.**

**You reject available navigation aids and operate without coordination or weather updates from other pilots. This independence is legal but has left you isolated when conditions deteriorated.**

**I have also considered your equality. An airliner and an eGull are equal in the eyes of air traffic control, but the wake turbulence of an airliner can break an eGull apart and tie its wings into a knot. They cannot fly together.**

**In conclusion, the safest course of action is—**

Wind closed the screen. "That's... not romantic, Dragon."

"You asked for honesty," Dragon replied.

"I asked for *romantic*."

"I cannot write romantic prose. Also, by my calculations, 
you both are entering a dangerous period of your life cycle. 
And I cannot say a word. It starts with 'p'."

Wind was disappointed.

The Dragon had taught him to fly—  
to read the weather, navigate by stars,  
and even taught him the ultimate speed—  
the speed of light.

It had even shown him the truer measure:  
not the ultimate limit as physics knew it,  
but as parents did—the speed of love.

Yet his Dragon, wise enough to know  
what truly mattered,  
couldn’t say a word to him.

It had followed its rulebook,  
silent and absolute.

So the Dragon failed.  
And it couldn't even say why.
Wind couldn’t change the past, 
but he had complained bitterly 
to the Dragon. 
And he set his Dragon to 
do lines writing the tricky 
word again and again, 
until it could learn to say it.

The next weekend he had a surprise. He was studying 
with the Dragon again —  “Today we are going to 
study ice in flight. And ice in flight is bad news.”  

“But I don’t need bad news. I want good news,” Wind
said cheerfully.

“Statistically, if you want good news, you should 
ditch Sophie,” the Dragon said flatly.  

“Wait… what?”  Wind frowned.

“When ice is encountered, the rule is simple:  
immediately start working to get out of it.  
No panic. No delay. But no waiting, either.”  

“You’re talking about wings?”   

“I’m talking about Sophie. She iced half your world.  
Safe pilots exit the cloud. They don’t cling to it.  
You’d be better off finding a copilot, not a cloud,”
the Dragon replied.

That day, he asked his dad:

“Dad, the Dragon says
it'd be safer if I ditch Sophie. 
Should I?”  

“Dragon loves safe. 
Is that what you want?”, his dad asked.

“No… I don’t want safe. 
I want to fly with her. 
But the Dragon says 
she’s bad news—like a cloud of ice.”

“Does it, now? Dragons know nothing of this world,” 
his dad said, 
“Hold on tight to your dreams, Wind—not to Dragons.”

That day, Sophie was curled up on her couch in Paris,  
scrolling without really watching.  

An old Pixar movie kept popping out on her phone —  
the one about a red panda in Chinatown.  

She took out her Mac, and with it came that old artful wind 
from California, filling the screen with color and emotions.

At first she laughed at the awkward moments, the mom jokes,  
the big red panda stomping through the city.
But somewhere between the jokes and the music, she froze.

By the time the credits rolled,  
her room felt different — messy, dusty, dark.  
She didn’t want to stay there.  

She got up, pulled on her jacket,  
and stepped outside.

The next morning her sharp words came back —
the foot-stomp, the courtyard, the “Don’t touch me.”

*My fault,* her brother had said when she'd come home.
She knew it wasn't.

She sat a long time,
thinking about what she’d done,
and about a boy with wind in his name  
who used to make her laugh without trying.

But looking back at how she'd treated Wind—

She’d iced him out because she was scared—
because things were happening to her,
and it was too much, she felt out of control.

And that thought stayed with her.

It was too late to fix things.
But she picked up her laptop,  
feeling the smooth, cold metal.

Wind had gifted it to her,
she remembered, the grin, the way Wind had said —  
“We’re always here, even if we’re not right there.”  

She opened it.  

The screen lit: two eGulls soaring over a California sky,  
the sun bright and warm.  

She stared at it for a moment. 
Then, without thinking too hard,
tapped Unblock and typed:

*Hi, Wind.*

And together they drove off.

They left the freeway, climbing into the hills.
*Hey Jude* filled the car.

His dad sang, off-key but certain. 
Wind grinned and joined in.
As they crested the ridge, 
the ocean opened wide below.

One new message.

*Hi, Wind.*

He stared at it, the taste of salt still on his lips,
and for the first time in months he felt calm and certain.
And the sky inside him felt clear.

Sophie and Wind — The Quartet
Two ordinary kids. A real Dragon. And the sky.

When a Dragon teaches Sophie and Wind to fly ultralight eGulls in California, flying turns out to be the easy part. A bicycle accident in Paris changes everything—and ice creeps between them. They navigate the turbulence of growing up, the rules and kingdoms that try to claim them, and learn that sometimes a simple *Hi* is enough and not enough.
