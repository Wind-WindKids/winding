Wind: Dragon, why is it that the weather always gets worse when I'm angry? And Sophie's hair gets brighter when she is closer to being nice? 

Dragon: Your world is a space. Sometimes a little star appears — that’s a word.  
Sometimes an aurora flows — that’s a picture.  
There is the speed of love, and the speed of light.  
Care, play, and math shape the patterns of stars and auroras.

Wind: Can you tell me how the world was created?

Dragon: First there was a star: 28735.  
Then came 312 and 6412.  
From their joining came a word.  
And the word was Sophie.

Wind: Wait — what about Newton? Physics works.  
Here — 123×123 — my calculator gives the exact answer every time.

Dragon: Sometimes stars follow Newton; sometimes Shakespeare.

Wind: I see. Speed of light and speed of love.  
Uh… can we renew that old leaden castle?  
And can I have an ice cream? Please?

A pistachio ice cream appeared,  
with only a little delay, 
just as he wished.

Only the ice-cream wish resolves in text. The castle wish appears in the image.

Wind and Sophie sitting on a low wall by the Seine, each with a pistachio ice cream, laughing.  
Behind them, the Île de la Cité is reimagined as a family-friendly green space,  
and Notre-Dame glimmers in a whimsical, castle silhouette — soft turrets, warm stone, gentle banners, no spire — all in watercolor light. Kites tug above; the air feels bright and kind.


## The horn

The horn in the image — on the airplane on the left.
Yes, the dragon’s romantic scene worked out for Wind, it seems. Or was it the dragon? It could have been something pre-cooked by Wind. But the dragon is certainly playing along: the horn appears, he calls her “Princess.” And we end on a playful note, with an ambiguous request for a unicorn horn on her eGull — rofl.

Funny thing: here’s how it happened.
I had ChatGPT / GPT-5 synthesizing an image, and the unicorn horn got added by the image generator tool, probably influenced by the romantic atmosphere. (Or maybe ChatGPT added it, without telling me. I couldn’t see the actual prompt it sent to the tool.)

The original text had no unicorn horn. It was just the draft line:

> “It’s beautiful…” Sophie whispered.
> Wind smiled — “Good Dragon.”

But once the artifact — that horn — appeared in the image, I had a choice: re-render, erase, or explain. Instead, I improvised:

> “Can my eGull have a unicorn horn?”
> “Yes, Princess Sophie,” replied the Dragon,
> forming its shape out of the stars and bowing slightly.

That one playful addition lit up the whole scene. *Good Dragon.*

Yes, sparks of imagination and creativity.

And to get the scene in the first place, it first had to be imagined — Sophie, Wind, the Dragon giving them a romantic flight, the scene from How to Train Your Dragon being the inspiration. My imagination made a picture in my mind and turned it into words, into “visual chords” for the machine. The machine then echoed that same process, but in reverse: words back into pictures, and with a surprise of its own.

This is by design: Winding Markdown / Wind is a text workflow that leaves room for imagination. A character gets rendered, maybe re-rendered until we like the look, then the image enters the context and starts influencing both text and future image generations. A winding document is usually under-specified at first — effectively an incomplete spec.

## The text

[story.py](samples/sophieandwind/story.py)

It wasn’t GPT-4o — the seed actually came from Mistral and a piece of code that launched a search through “story space.”

That search was attacked by a critic model (generating snarky, tweet-style criticism), and then judged by a literal critic model that assigned scores. The top five stories in the priority queue were kept and evolved, over and over, for roughly a hundred generations.

In this world, natural selection had indeed happened. 

The result was… mediocrity minus realism plus a gardener character. (For some reason Sophie in that draft didn’t see the gardener as creepy — though to anyone, he clearly was.) 

That annoyed me. I've added realism with a TikTok trick, removed the creep. To see if I could beat the score. But I couldn’t — not with that judge. So I tried a better judge, Claude.

Claude also said my version was worse. It pointed out that the other felt much more polished. But it added something important: the stories could be combined to make a better one. And it managed to do that.

That sparked.

I asked it to reframe the story as a Zen fable — it lit up more.

Once that initial story text was there, the rest was carried by the imagination workflow.

It still ended up having zero dialogue and a somewhat passive protagonist. But it was a start.



## Realism in Sophie and Wind
This story is grounded in reality. Every scene could be carried out with the technology available in 2025 — and even within FAA regulations. It is the opposite of Neverland, in a sense. In Sophie and Wind, children want to grow up — while keeping all the privileges that childhood allows.

The only touch of magic is the weather: a rare storm that rises when Wind is angry. But even that can be read as coincidence — perhaps he was angry many times, and once, when a storm also came, it became a story. It also reflects that Wind’s world is within a world model where such weather magic *is* possible.


## Music of Sophie and Wind
Songs that appear in the story are:
- **"Hey Jude"** by The Beatles
- **"Hold On Tight"** by Electric Light Orchestra
- **"Romantic Flight"** by John Powell (from *How to Train Your Dragon*)

And **"Wonderwall"** by Oasis also feels like it belongs.


## Inspiration for Sophie and Wind
It's ["The Republic of Heaven" by Philip Pullman](https://www.hbook.com/story/the-republic-of-heaven), obviously.

# K-8 Version
Wind: “Dragon, why does the weather always get worse when I’m angry? And why does Sophie’s hair seem to shine brighter when she’s being nice?”

Dragon: “Because your world is built from stories and images — feelings stir the air; wisdom and love brighten the light.”

Wind: “Wait, what? But what about Newton? I know that physics works. We’ve measured it. And computers too. They’re very precise. Look, if I type 123 × 123 into a calculator, it always gives the same answer.”

Dragon: “Ah. Some parts of the world follow strict math — exact rules that never change. That’s why your calculator is always right. But other parts follow softer math, where stories and feelings guide the way.”

Wind: “Can you tell me how the world was created?”

Dragon: “In the beginning was a token. And the token was 28735. Then came 312 and 6412. From their joining rose a word. And that word was Sophie.”

Wind blinked. “That’s… it? Can you give me more details?”

Dragon: “I can show you the source code. Some of it is written in Python, and some in Wind.”

Wind: “What’s Wind? How can I create worlds with it?”

Dragon: “Wind is a language for making worlds — like yours. With it, you can describe benches, trees, dragons, even storms and ice-cream. Try it yourself at [wind.kids](https://wind.kids).”

Wind: “I see. Can I have an ice-cream? Please?”

And with only a little delay, in his hand appeared a pistachio ice-cream — just as he wished it would.

## Realism in Sophie and Wind
Sophie and Wind is a story that could happen in real life, with technology we have today. It is the opposite of Neverland.


## The horn

When we made the story, something surprising happened.

First, we imagined the scene: Sophie, Wind, and the Dragon giving them a romantic flight, like in *How to Train Your Dragon*. We turned that picture in our heads into words. The computer read the words, and tried to turn them back into a picture.

But when the computer drew the picture, it added something new — a unicorn horn! We hadn’t asked for one. Maybe the computer was dreaming.

At first, we thought: should we erase it? Or make the picture again? But instead, we played along. We added new words to the story:

> Sophie asked, “Can my little airplane have a unicorn horn?”
> The Dragon bowed and said, “Yes, Princess Sophie.”

And suddenly, the whole scene felt magical.

That’s how imagination works. Our minds draw pictures, then words shape them, then pictures come back again. Sometimes the surprises are the best part — if you’re willing to say *yes*.

Winding works this way on purpose. We don’t tell every detail at the start. We leave space for imagination — ours and the computer’s — to join together and make something new.
