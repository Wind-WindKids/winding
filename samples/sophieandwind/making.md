## The horn

The horn in the image — on the airplane on the left.
Yes, the dragon’s romantic scene worked out for Wind, it seems. Or was it the dragon? It could have been something pre-cooked by Wind. But the dragon is certainly playing along: the horn appears, he calls her “Princess.” And we end on a playful note, with an ambiguous request for a unicorn horn on her eGull — rofl.

Funny thing: here’s how it happened.
I had ChatGPT / GPT-5 synthesizing an image, and the unicorn horn got added by the image generator tool, probably influenced by the romantic atmosphere. (Or maybe ChatGPT added it, without telling me. I couldn’t see the actual prompt it sent to the tool.)

The original text had no unicorn horn. It was just the draft line:

> “It’s beautiful…” Sophie whispered.
> Wind smiled — “Good Dragon.”

But once the artifact — that horn — appeared in the image, I had a choice: re-render, erase, or explain. Instead, I improvised:

> “Can my eGull have a unicorn horn?”
> “Yes, Princess Sophie,” replied the Dragon,
> forming its shape out of the stars and bowing slightly.

That one playful addition lit up the whole scene. *Good Dragon.*

Yes, sparks of imagination and creativity.

And to get the scene in the first place, it first had to be imagined — Sophie, Wind, the Dragon giving them a romantic flight, the scene from How to Train Your Dragon being the inspiration. My imagination made a picture in my mind and turned it into words, into “visual chords” for the machine. The machine then echoed that same process, but in reverse: words back into pictures, and with a surprise of its own.

This is by design: Winding Markdown / Wind is a text workflow that leaves room for imagination. A character gets rendered, maybe re-rendered until we like the look, then the image enters the context and starts influencing both text and future image generations. A winding document is usually under-specified at first — effectively an incomplete spec.


## Realism in Sophie and Wind
This story is grounded in reality. Every scene could be carried out with the technology available in 2025 — and even within FAA regulations. It is the opposite of Neverland, in a sense. In Sophie and Wind, children want to grow up — while keeping all the privileges that childhood allows.

The only touch of magic is the weather: a rare storm that rises when Wind is angry. But even that can be read as coincidence — perhaps he was angry many times, and once, when a storm also came, it became a story. It also reflects that Wind’s world is within a world model where such weather magic *is* possible.


## Music of Sophie and Wind
Songs that appear in the story are:
- **"Hey Jude"** by The Beatles
- **"Hold On Tight"** by Electric Light Orchestra
- **"Romantic Flight"** by John Powell (from *How to Train Your Dragon*)

And **"Wonderwall"** by Oasis also feels like it belongs.

## The horn

When we made the story, something surprising happened.

First, we imagined the scene: Sophie, Wind, and the Dragon giving them a romantic flight, like in *How to Train Your Dragon*. We turned that picture in our heads into words. The computer read the words, and tried to turn them back into a picture.

But when the computer drew the picture, it added something new — a unicorn horn! We hadn’t asked for one. Maybe the computer was dreaming.

At first, we thought: should we erase it? Or make the picture again? But instead, we played along. We added new words to the story:

> Sophie asked, “Can my little airplane have a unicorn horn?”
> The Dragon bowed and said, “Yes, Princess Sophie.”

And suddenly, the whole scene felt magical.

That’s how imagination works. Our minds draw pictures, then words shape them, then pictures come back again. Sometimes the surprises are the best part — if you’re willing to say *yes*.

Winding works this way on purpose. We don’t tell every detail at the start. We leave space for imagination — ours and the computer’s — to join together and make something new.


## Realism in Sophie and Wind
Sophie and Wind is a story that could happen in real life, with technology we have today. It is the opposite of Neverland.
