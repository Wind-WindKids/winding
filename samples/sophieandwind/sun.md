Part 4
Sophie and Sun

@image:
Sophie standing at the foot of wide stone church steps, looking toward the sunny park beyond. She wears a light summer dress and sandals. In the park, colorful kites tug in the wind, leaves swirl, and children laugh in the distance. The Eiffel Tower rises faintly in the background.

Sundays had always been the same.  

Sophie’s mother would take her  
to the old stone building  
with a leaden roof  
at the end of the street.

“Come inside, Sophie,” her mother called.

Sophie shook her head.  

“But Mom, it’s so sunny out! And I love to play with Wind.”

Her mother paused. Sophie grinned. “I think Sundays are windier than other days, because it’s sun that makes the wind.”

“Can I go to the park instead?”

“Sophie, it is important. All your friends are going to be there.”

“Please? I really want to go, while it’s still sunny.”

“All right.”

“Thank you, Mom.”

Sophie turned and walked toward the park.

In the park, Sophie saw three kids from a
kite workshop she and Wind had been leading,
where kids would make and fly dragon kites.

They were trying to launch a genormous dragon kite. 
It kept going out of alignment, twisting its tail, 
then flopping right back down onto the kids.

Sophie looked at it for a while, then walked over.  
“Hi! Need some help?” she asked, 
“I see what’s wrong. We can fix it.”

But when she checked her pockets, 
all she found was two pencils, 
a paper square, and a phone, 
“But we do need tape,” she said.

She thought of the pharmacy,  
but Madame Madeleine—  
who always kept a roll of every kind of tape 
behind the counter — was away,
she remembered seeing the pharmacy door locked.

Then she tried texting Wind.

*Got a kite emergency — bring tape?*  
Three dots appear… then vanish.  
Next message: *Later.*

Sophie thought hard about anything that used tape and where she could get some.  
“Let’s go to the flower shop,” she said to the kids.  
“It’s right at the edge of the park, and they’ll give us tape.”  

At the flower shop, the sign read: *Open at noon*.
Sophie stopped. Closed, closed, closed.

She tried the little café by the pond — 
chairs stacked, door locked.  

Maybe her mom was right, after all. 
It seemed like everyone was not there.

She looked around. 
The park was full of things, 
but none that were quite right.

She was about to pull out her phone to check the map, but she stopped.  
A boy nearby was walking toward the café, crumpling an empty water bottle.  

“Wait!” she called.  
“Can I have your bottle? It’s for a kite rescue.”  

The boy looked at her, then at the kite, then back at her.
“Is this a normal Sunday for you?” he asked, handing her the bottle.

“Pretty much,” Sophie said, smiling.
“Thanks!”

They’d requisitioned one of the café tables 
and a few chairs as an improvised workshop.  

One of the kids had a Swiss Army knife, 
and in no time they’d peeled a sticky label from the bottle, 
trimmed it into an oval patch, and pressed it over the tear.

Children gathered around the café table, Sophie leaning over the kite, carefully pressing the patch in place.

“Oh, Wind — nice,” Sophie said, giving him a quick kiss on the cheek, “You’re late.”

“Sorry I got stuck.”

“It’s nice that you’re here now, in sunlight. 
Did you escape through a window?”

“Almost!” Wind smiled. 
“They don't force you to stay, 
but it feels rude to leave.”

Sophie nodded, a little worried. 
“Mom says they used to force you — 
but not anymore. Not here.
It's you who decide.”

“Come on,” Wind said.
"Let's go share an ice cream.
There's a new place, 
they have pistachio.”

“Look, Wind - the dragon is now up there, 
right above the playground. 
The kids are keeping it aligned,” Sophie said.

“Yeah, it’s flying great, love it,” Wind replied.

They ate ice cream.
Sunlight caught in Sophie’s hair, 
turned it bright, iridescent gold.

“That color… it’s really my favorite,” Wind said, 
twirling a strand in the light.

Sophie watched him, took his hand and smiled—  
“Sundays are for sun and friends,” Sophie said, 
“and kites, and ice cream.”

Wind grinned.  
"Yeah, and birthday cakes."

Sophie and Wind at a small café table in a green Paris square, each with a pistachio ice-cream cone; two mugs on the table. Behind them, a friendly, castle silhouette: soft turrets, blue roofs, small banners, kites drift overhead, it looks suspiciously like Notre-Dame. A giant golden dragon kite is soaring above that castle. A playground and strolling families dot the lawn. Watercolor light, bright and kind.

The next winter, Sophie’s mom didn’t let her  
go to California. But it didn’t matter.  

Their lessons, their flying, their Dragon —  
they had already made the difference.  

Sophie and Wind were ordinary children.  

But they knew the rules were not the same everywhere,  
and that sometimes they could write their own.  
In the sky.

Epilogue — The Quartet

“Not the Dragon again, Wind. He’s scary,” Sophie said.

“I’ve been training him — Dad helped too. Come see,” — 
and “show her you can sing.”, Wind said to the Dragon.

“I am an instructor, not a troubadour,” the Dragon replied.  

“Dragon. Play.”  

The Dragon bowed slightly. Its silhouette brightened,
breaking apart into sparks — into a golden constellation in the sky.

The simulator darkened. The eGull faded into night.
A violin rose, drawing the shape of a single eGull across the stars.
Another joined, then another —
lines of light weaving harmony in the sky.

At the peak, two eGulls lifted above the cloudtops.
The horizon glowed with sunrise.

“It’s beautiful…”, Sophie whispered.
Wind smiled — “Good Dragon.”

“Can my eGull have a unicorn horn? Please?”

“Yes, Princess Sophie,” replied the Dragon, 
forming its shape out of the stars,
with only a little delay, and bowing slightly.

“Thank you,”  — and both of them smiled.
