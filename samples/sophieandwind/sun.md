@Wind.clothes: summer
Slim-fit linen shirt in teal, short sleeves, lightly tailored to the body. Mid-thigh shorts in light gray, clean cut, slightly fitted. White low-top sneakers with short white socks, visible just above the shoe line. Overall look neat, practical, and slightly fashionable.

@Sophie.clothes: summer
A light, slim summer dress, soft linen in pale cream or light sky-blue tones. Dress has open shoulders with thin straps, slightly flared at the hem, falling just above the knee. Simple but graceful, with a faint floral or subtle stripe pattern to suggest texture without clutter. Worn with flat sandals or slip-on shoes in light brown leather.

Part 4
Sophie and Sun

@image:
Sophie standing at the foot of wide stone church steps, looking toward the sunny park beyond. In the park, colorful kites tug in the wind, leaves swirl, and children laugh in the distance.

Sundays had always been the same.  

Sophie’s mother would take her  
to the old stone building  
with a heavy leaden roof  
at the end of the street.

“Come inside, Sophie,” her mother called.

Sophie shook her head.  

“Mom, I came with you here, 
but I’d rather be outside. With Wind.”

Her mother paused. Sophie grinned. 

“I think Sundays are windier than other days, 
because it’s the sun that makes the wind,
and because it’s Sunday, Wind isn't at school.
So can I just go to the park instead?”

“Sophie, it is important. 
Everyone is going to be there.”

“Please?”

“All right.”

“Thank you, Mom.”

And Sophie headed straight toward the park.

In the park, Sophie saw three kids from a
kite workshop she and Wind had been leading,
where kids would make and fly dragon kites.

They were trying to launch a dragon kite. It was big...
It kept going out of alignment, twisting its tail, 
then flopping right back down onto the kids.

Sophie watched them for a while, then walked over.
“Hey, want a hand?” she asked, 
“I can see what’s off. We’ll get it fixed.”

But when she checked her pockets, 
all she found was two pencils, 
a paper square, and a phone, 
“But we do need tape,” she said.

She thought of the pharmacy,  
but Madame Madeleine—  
who always kept a roll of every kind of tape 
behind the counter — was away,
she remembered seeing the pharmacy door locked.

Then she tried texting Wind.

*Got a kite — bring tape?*  
Three dots appear… then vanish.  
Next message: *Later.*

Sophie thought hard about anything that used tape and where she could get some.  
“Let’s go to the flower shop,” she said to the kids.  
“It’s right at the edge of the park, and they’ll give us tape.”  

At the flower shop, the sign read: *Open at noon*.
Sophie stopped. Closed, closed, closed.

She tried the little café right next — 
chairs stacked, door locked.  

Maybe her mom was right, after all. 
It seemed like everyone was not there.

She was about to pull out her phone, 
but a boy nearby was walking toward the café, 
crumpling an empty water bottle.  

“Hey!” she called.  
“Can I have your bottle?”  

The boy looked at her.

“I just need the plastic.  
We’re fixing a kite.” 

He handed it over, still curious.  
“That huge dragon kite— 
is it yours?”  

“Sort of. Depends if we get it in the air.”

They’d requisitioned one of the café tables 
and a few chairs as an improvised workshop.  

One of the kids had a Swiss Army knife, 
they’d peeled a sticky label from the bottle, 
trimmed it into an oval patch, 
and pressed it over the tear.

Children gathered around the café table, Sophie leaning over the kite, carefully pressing the patch in place.

“Oh, Wind — nice,” Sophie said, 
giving him a quick kiss on the cheek, 
“You’re late.”

“Sorry I got stuck.”

“Was there a whooshing sound  
when you made it through a window?”  

“Almost!” Wind grinned. 
“They don't force you to stay, 
but it sure feels like it.”

Sophie nodded, a bit worried. 
“Mom says they used to force you — 
but not anymore. Not here.
It's you who decide.”

“Come on,” Wind said, “Let’s go get ice cream. 
There's a new place, they have pistachio.”

“Look, Wind — the dragon. They’ve released it,
it’s gliding now,” Sophie said.  

“Yeah, flying free — it looks great,” Wind replied.  
“Love it.”  

They ate ice cream.
Sunlight caught in Sophie’s hair, 
turned it bright, iridescent gold.

“That color… it’s my favorite,” Wind said, 
twirling a strand in the light.

“See? This is what Sundays should be for — 
sun, friends, and ice cream.”

Wind grinned.  
"Yeah, and birthday cakes."

renewed_castle: page, image, portrait-oriented

Sophie and Wind at a small café table in a green Paris square, each with a pistachio ice-cream cone; two mugs on the table. Behind them, a friendly, castle silhouette: soft turrets, blue roofs, small banners, kites drift overhead, it looks suspiciously like Notre-Dame. A giant golden dragon kite is soaring above that castle. A playground and strolling families dot the lawn. Watercolor light, bright and kind.

The next winter, they were flying again.

Together.  

Sophie and Wind were ordinary children.  

But they knew the rules were not the same everywhere,  
and that sometimes they could write their own.  
In the sky.

Their trails spell: **Hello World!**
