Part 4
Sophie and Sun

@image:
Sophie standing at the foot of wide stone church steps, looking toward the sunny park beyond. She wears a light summer dress and sandals. In the park, colorful kites tug in the wind, leaves swirl, and children laugh in the distance. The Eiffel Tower rises faintly in the background.

Sundays had always been the same.  

Sophie’s mother would take her 
to the old stone building 
at the end of the street.

Sophie didn’t like going.  
Wind didn’t like it much either.  

There were candles and echoes, 
and then there were rumors 
that kids whispered to each other. 
And sometimes a friend went quiet, 
as if someone else held their words.

“Come inside, Sophie,” her mother called.

Sophie shook her head.  

“But Mom, it’s so sunny out! And I love to play with Wind.”

Her mother paused. Sophie grinned. “I think Sundays are windier than other days, because it’s sun that makes the wind.”

“Can I go to the park instead?”

“Sophie, it is important. All your friends are going to be there.”

“Please? I really want to go, while it’s still sunny.”

“All right.”

“Thank you, Mom.”

Sophie turned and ran toward the park.

In the wide grass, three younger children were trying to get a kite into the air.  
It flopped and spun in the wind, a jagged tear in its bright plastic sail.  

“We can fix it,” Sophie said.  
But when she checked her pockets, all she found was two pencils, a paper square, and a phone.  
“We need tape.”

was away.

Sophie thought hard about anything that used tape and where she could get some.  
“Let’s go to the flower shop,” she said to the kids.  
“It’s right at the edge of the park, and they’ll give us tape.”  

At the flower shop, the sign read: *Open at noon*.
Sophie stopped. Closed, closed, closed.

She tried the little café by the pond — chairs stacked, door locked.  
She looked around. The park was full of things, but none that were quite right.

She was about to pull out her phone to check the map, but she stopped.  
A boy nearby was walking toward the café, crumpling an empty water bottle.  

“Wait!” she called.  
“Can I have your bottle? It’s for a kite rescue.”  

@right: page, image
Sophie catching up to the boy with the bottle, sunlight flashing on the crinkled plastic, the kite and kids visible in the background. Boy going to the trash can near the café, but stopped to hand the bottle to Sophie.

The boy smiled at her and looked at the kite.  
They’d requisitioned one of the café tables and a few chairs as an improvised workshop.  
One of the kids had a Swiss Army knife, and in no time they’d peeled a sticky label from the bottle, trimmed it into an oval patch, and pressed it over the tear.

Children gathered around the café table, Sophie leaning over the kite, carefully pressing the patch in place.

“Oh, Wind — nice,” Sophie said, giving him a quick kiss on the cheek, “You’re late.”

“Sorry I got stuck.”

“It’s nice that you’re here now, in sunlight. 
Did you escape through a window?”

“Almost!” Wind smiled. 
“They don't force you to stay, 
but it feels rude to leave.”

Sophie nodded, a little worried. 
“Mom says they used to force you — 
but not anymore. Not here.
It is you who decides.”

“Come on,” Wind said.
"Let's go share an ice cream.
There's a new place, 
they have pistachio."

They ate ice cream.
Sunlight caught in Sophie’s hair, turned it bright, iridescent gold.

“That color… it’s really my favorite,” Wind said, twirling a strand.


Sophie watched the kite’s tail flicker against the wide sky, took Wind’s hand and smiled—  

“Sundays are for sun and friends,” Sophie said.  
“And for flying stuff. Not burning candles.”  

Wind grinned.  
“Unless it’s on a birthday cake.”

Sophie and Wind at a small café table in a green Paris square, each with a pistachio ice-cream cone; two mugs on the table. Behind them, a friendly, castle silhouette: soft turrets, blue roofs, small banners, kites drift overhead, it looks suspiciously like Notre-Dame. A playground and strolling families dot the lawn. Watercolor light, bright and kind.

@left: page, text
The next week at the kite workshop, 
Sophie handed out papers.
On each was a drawing of kites, some light, 
some heavy, some with torn sails.

She explained the quiz:

Circle the kites that will fly the best, 
Cross out the ones that will not. 
Use aspect ratio, balance, and weight.
Two minutes to solve it all.  

One kid squinted at the page, hand shooting up.  
“This isn’t fair! We’ve never covered aspect ratio.”  

“It’s in the syllabus.”  

Wind, observing the workshop from the back, almost laughed.  
He’d heard that line before.  

@right: page, image
Sophie’s handout.

Circle the kites that will fly the best, 
Cross out the ones that will not. 
Use aspect ratio, balance, and weight.
Two minutes to solve it all.  


@image:  
A spread with a watercolor illustration of a park scene,
on the grass there are six kites, numbered 1 to 6.

1. A light carbon fiber cross shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:2.
2. A light carbon fiber diamond shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:1.
3. A light carbon fiber square shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:1.
4. A heavy cross shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:2, with a thick wooden frame.
5. A heavy diamond shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:1, with a thick wooden frame.
6. A heavy square shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:1, with a thick wooden frame.

A few other kites are scattered around, not numbered, some with a torn sail, some with missing tails.

Same handout as before, 
but with a thick line added to #4,
to make the cross kite look like a "4" —
And then that kite is crossed out.

@text: big, red, mark
17%

@text: margin, note, small, red, handwritten
Review aspect ratio, weight and balance.

@comment: hidden
The kite that will fly the best is #2, the light carbon fiber diamond kite with an aspect ratio of 1:1.
The rest will not fly the best or will not fly at all, due to their suboptimal weight and balance or aspect ratio.
The correct answer is to circle #2, cross out #1, #3, #4, #5, and #6. The student crossed out #4.
One correct, 1/6 = 0.166666… ≈ 16.67%. Rounded up to 17%. 

@dragon: hidden
A heavy kite, shaped like a cross, cannot rise.
A line turns it into a “4,” a number of death.
Crossed out again, death itself is negated.

The learner earns only 17%, a failing mark.
Yet in the fractions behind it, 666 turns to 667.

Once, I lived at 667 Eden,
and then came Sophie.

A drawing on a whiteboard, with six kites sketched in a grid.

@text: handwritten

| Shape | cross | diamond | square |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| Light |  1    |   2     |   3    |
| Heavy |  4    |   5     |   6    |

The top row: light frames — they would fly.
The diamond kite would fly best, balanced and right aspect ratio for the kite.
Correct answer is to circle #2, cross out #1, #3, #4, #5, and #6.

Epilogue — The Quartet

@left: page, text
“Not the Dragon again, Wind. He’s scary.”, Sophie said.

“I’ve been training him — Dad helped too. Come see.  
We’ve scared her enough times. Now show her you can sing.”  

“I am an instructor, not a troubadour,” the Dragon replied.  

“Dragon. Play.”  

The Dragon bowed slightly. Its silhouette brightened,
breaking apart into sparks — into a golden constellation in the sky.

The simulator darkened. The eGull faded into night.
A violin rose, drawing the shape of a single eGull across the stars.
Another joined, then another —
lines of light weaving harmony in the sky.

At the peak, two eGulls lifted above the cloudtops.
The horizon glowed with sunrise.

“It’s beautiful…”, Sophie whispered.
Wind smiled — “Good Dragon.”

“Can my eGull have a unicorn horn? Please?”`

“Yes, Princess Sophie,” replied the Dragon, 
forming its shape out of the stars,
with only a little delay, and bowing slightly.

“Thank you,”  — and both of them smiled.

That winter, Sophie’s mom didn’t let her go to California.  
But it didn’t matter.  

Their lessons, their flying, their Dragon —  
they had already made the difference.  

Sophie and Wind were ordinary children.  
But they knew the rules were not the same everywhere,  
and that sometimes they could write their own.  
In the sky.
