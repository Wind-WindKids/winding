Part 4
Sophie and Sun

@image:
Sophie standing at the foot of wide stone church steps, looking toward the sunny park beyond. She wears a light summer dress and sandals. In the park, colorful kites tug in the wind, leaves swirl, and children laugh in the distance. The Eiffel Tower rises faintly in the background.

Sundays had always been the same.  
Sophie’s mother would take her to the tall stone church at the end of the street.  
There were candles and echoes and long rows of people sitting very still.

“Come inside, Sophie,” her mother called.

Sophie shook her head.  

“But Mom, it’s so sunny out! And I love to play with wind.”

Her mother paused. Sophie grinned. “I think Sundays are windier than other days, because it’s sun that makes the wind.”

“Can I go to the park instead of going to the Mess?”

“Sophie, it is important to go to Mass. All your friends are going to be there.”

“Please? I really want to go, while it’s still sunny.”

“All right.”

“Thank you, Mom.”

Sophie turned and walked toward the park.

In the wide grass, three younger children were trying to get a kite into the air.  
It flopped and spun in the wind, a jagged tear in its bright paper skin.  

“We can fix it,” Sophie said.  
But when she checked her pockets, all she found was two pencils, a paper square, and a phone.  
“We need tape.”

Sophie thought hard about anything that used tape and where she could get some.  
“Let’s go to the flower shop,” she said to the kids.  
“It’s right at the edge of the park, and they’ll give us tape.”  

At the flower shop, the sign read: *Open at noon*.
Sophie stopped. Closed, closed, closed.

She tried the little café by the pond — chairs stacked, door locked.  
She looked around. The park was full of things, but none that were quite right.

She was about to pull out her phone to check the map, but she stopped.  
A boy nearby was walking toward the café, crumpling an empty water bottle.  

“Wait!” she called.  
“Can I have your bottle? It’s for a kite rescue.”  

@right: page, image
Sophie catching up to the boy with the bottle, sunlight flashing on the crinkled plastic, the kite and kids visible in the background. Boy going to the trash can near the café, but stopped to hand the bottle to Sophie.

The boy smiled at her and looked at the kite.  
They’d requisitioned one of the café tables and a few chairs as an improvised workshop.  
One of the kids had a Swiss Army knife, and in no time they’d peeled a sticky label from the bottle, trimmed it into an oval patch, and pressed it over the tear.

Children gathered around the café table, Sophie leaning over the kite, carefully pressing the patch in place.

“Oh, Wind — nice,” Sophie said, giving him a quick kiss on the cheek, “You’re late.”

“Sorry I got stuck in church.”

“It’s nice that you’re here now, in sunlight. Did you escape through a window?”

“Almost!” Wind smiled. “You know I don’t do well with all that... darkness.”

“But you went anyway.”

“Well, yeah. You were going.” He touched her hair, watching the sun play in it. “Worth it though. That color... it’s really my favorite.”

Sophie watched the kite’s tail flicker against the wide sky, took Wind’s hand and smiled—  

“Sundays are for sun and friends,” Sophie said. “And for flying stuff. Not burning candles.”  

Wind grinned. “Unless it’s on a birthday cake.”

@left: page, text
The next week at the kite workshop, Sophie handed out papers.
At the kite workshop, Sophie handed out papers.  
On each was a drawing of diverse kites, some light, 
some heavy, some with torn sails.

She explained the quiz:

Circle the kites that will fly the best, 
Cross out the ones that will not. 
Use aspect ratio, balance, and weight.
Two minutes to solve it all.  

One kid squinted at the page, hand shooting up.  
“This isn’t fair! We’ve never covered aspect ratio.”  

“It’s in the syllabus.”  

Wind, observing the workshop from the back, almost laughed.  
He’d heard that line before.  

@right: page, image
Sophie’s handout.

Circle the kites that will fly the best, 
Cross out the ones that will not. 
Use aspect ratio, balance, and weight.
Two minutes to solve it all.  


@image:  
A spread with a watercolor illustration of a park scene,
on the grass there are six kites, numbered 1 to 6.

1. A light carbon fiber cross shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:2.
2. A light carbon fiber diamond shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:1.
3. A light carbon fiber square shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:1.
4. A heavy cross shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:2, with a thick wooden frame.
5. A heavy diamond shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:1, with a thick wooden frame.
6. A heavy square shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:1, with a thick wooden frame.

A few other kites are scattered around, not numbered, some with a torn sail, some with missing tails.

@left: page, image, portrait-oriented
Same handout as before, 
but with a thick line added to #4,
to make the cross kite look like a "4" —
And then that kite is crossed out.

@text: big, red, mark
17%

@text: margin, note, small, red, handwritten
Review aspect ratio, weight and balance.

@comment: hidden
The kite that will fly the best is #2, the light carbon fiber diamond kite with an aspect ratio of 1:1.
The rest will not fly the best or will not fly at all, due to their suboptimal weight and balance or aspect ratio.
The correct answer is to circle #2, cross out #1, #3, #4, #5, and #6. The student crossed out #4.
One correct, 1/6 = 0.166666… ≈ 16.67%. Rounded up to 17%. 

@dragon: hidden
A heavy kite, shaped like a cross, cannot rise.
A line turns it into a “4,” a number of death.
Crossed out again, death itself is negated.

The learner earns only 17%, a failing mark.
Yet in the fractions behind it, 666 turns to 667.

Once, I lived at 667 Eden,
and then came Sophie.



@right: page, image, portrait-oriented
A drawing on a whiteboard, with six kites sketched in a grid.

@text: handwritten

| Shape | cross | diamond | square |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| Light |  1    |   2     |   3    |
| Heavy |  4    |   5     |   6    |

The top row: light frames — they would fly.
The diamond kite would fly best, balanced and right aspect ratio for the kite.
Correct answer is to circle #2, cross out #1, #3, #4, #5, and #6.

Epilogue — The Quartet

@left: page, text
“Not the Dragon again, Wind. He’s scary.”, Sophie said.

“I’ve been training him — Dad helped too. Come see.  
We’ve scared her enough times. Now show her you can sing.”  

“I am an instructor, not a troubadour,” the Dragon replied.  

“Dragon. Play.”  

The Dragon bowed slightly. Its silhouette brightened, shimmering, 
breaking apart into sparks — into a golden constellation in the sky.


The simulator darkens. The eGull fades into night.  
A lone violin begins to play, its sound painting the shape of a single eGull across the stars.  
Another violin joins — another eGull appears, flying in harmony.  
And then another, and another.
One by one they gather, lines of light weaving harmony across the night.

Then music swells, mountains shimmer, the orchestra builds.  

At the peak, two eGulls lift above the cloudtops,  
soaring serenely to the twin voices of violins.  
The others fall back, then rejoin, the orchestra
soaring with the violins leading, reaching a crescendo.
The sky brightens with sunrise.

Gradually, the sound softens.

@text:
“It’s beautiful…”, Sophie whispered.
Wind smiled — “Good Dragon.”

“Can my eGull have a unicorn horn? Please?”`

“Yes, Princess Sophie,” replied the Dragon, 
forming its shape out of the stars,
with only a little delay, and bowing slightly.

“Thank you,”  — and both of them smiled.

The End

the_poem: page, portrait-oriented
theme: silver-gold, morning light, playful and riddle-like

@page: text, tiny, cursive, centered
It’s dark inside,  
but sun still finds me  
shaking shades  
where echoes unwind me.  

I stand by the steps where shadows stay,  
but sun is calling me to learn and play.  
A voice calls half-drunk, but wind says *no*—  
fly to the sunny side where wings can go.  

I warm my wings, then ride the breeze—  
with the wind and through the trees.  
Petals wide, nectar to flow—  
sun coaxes them to live and grow.  

Deep in the park I stand so wide,  
leaves drinking light on the sunlit side.  
Wind lifts my seeds to faraway ground—  
new trees grow where the light is found.  

When you know me, you’ll understand—  
I follow sun across the land.  
And Sun Days are best—  
when the sky is wide,  
with me and friends  
flying by your side.

                      Sophie and Wind.

@background:
soft watercolor leaves, drifting sunbeams, faint kite tails curling between stanzas.

Art
The generative AI art in *Sophie and Sun* is not without flaws. If you'd like to illuminate your own version, please visit [wind.kids](https://wind.kids).

Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the many magnificent ones—large and small—who have opened access to their models, technologies, and the modern digital art workshop: a true bicycle-for-the-mind. Without these tools, Sophie and Sun would never have fit within the constraints of everyday life, and simply wouldn't have been possible.

What began as a bike is now almost a fusion-powered flying dragon for the mind. With deep gratitude to the creators, scientists, engineers, artists, and dreamers who share their knowledge and imagination with the world. 

And this story was shaped by those who see, with clear eyes, that the truest republic is already here: in friendship, in learning, in love, and in sunlight.
