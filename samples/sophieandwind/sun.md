@Sophie:
A girl of about twelve, slim but beginning to show the taller, more defined proportions of her age. Her hair is light brown, sun-kissed blond often loose and gently wavy, falling to her shoulders. Her skin is fair, her features soft yet gradually more refined. She has large, expressive hazel-brown eyes that hold both curiosity and a quiet seriousness. Her neutral expression is calm, sometimes with the suggestion of a smile, giving her an air of poise that feels just a step beyond childhood.

Slim-fit linen shirt in teal, short sleeves, lightly tailored to the body. Mid-thigh shorts in light gray, clean cut, slightly fitted. White low-top sneakers with short white socks, visible just above the shoe line. Overall look neat, practical, and slightly fashionable.

@Sophie.clothes: summer
A light, slim summer dress, soft linen in pale cream or light sky-blue tones. Dress has open shoulders with thin straps, slightly flared at the hem, falling just above the knee. Simple but graceful, with a faint floral or subtle stripe pattern to suggest texture without clutter. Worn with flat sandals or slip-on shoes in light brown leather.

Sundays had always been the same.  

Sophie’s mother would take her  
to the old stone building  
with a heavy leaden roof  
at the end of the street.

She went, she believed the stories—
she believed they were true—
but they weren’t hers,
and they never seemed to help her.

“Come inside, Sophie,” her mother called.

Sophie shook her head.

@text:
Her mother paused. Sophie grinned. 

“I think Sundays are windier than other days, 
because it’s the sun that makes the wind,
and because it’s Sunday, Wind isn't at school.
So can I just go to the park instead?”

“Sophie, it is important. 
Everyone will be there.”

“I don't want to, Please?
You told me you wouldn't force me to go.”

“All right.”

“Thank you, Mom.”

And Sophie headed straight toward the park.
The sun was bright, the air warm, 
and the stories could wait.

In the park, Sophie saw two kids from a
kite workshop she and Wind had been leading,
where kids would make and fly dragon kites.

They were trying to repair a large kite.

Sophie watched them for a while, then walked over.
“Hey, want a hand?” she asked.

“I can see what’s off. We’ll get it fixed. 
But we do need ripstop sail tape.” she said.

@image:
Far away, in the field, two kids are arranging a large kite on a grassy field, Sophie approaching them. The kite is pale yellow, a yellow head, made out of a loose set of individual disks forming a rough shape of a dragon, with around 10 disks for each wing, 10 smaller ones for the tail, 10 for the body, It is very large, and the whole set is spread on the grass.

She thought of the workshop tools and tape—
but the workshop was at the back of the church.

And she was too embarrassed to go back there.

She thought of the pharmacy, Madame Madeleine—  
who always kept a roll of every kind of tape 
behind the counter — she was at the church.

And the little café right next— 
chairs stacked, door locked.  

Her mom was right. The adults were out.

Then she tried texting Wind.

*Got a kite — bring ripstop?*  
Three dots appear… then vanish.  
Next message: *Later.*

A boy nearby was walking toward the café, 
crumpling an empty water bottle.  

“Hey!” she called.  
“Can I have your bottle?”  

The boy looked at her.

“I just need the plastic.  
We’re fixing a kite.” 

He handed it over, still curious.  
“That huge dragon kite— 
is it yours?”  

“Sort of. Depends if we get it in the air.”

@left: page, text
One of the kids had a Swiss Army knife, 
they’d peeled a sticky label from the bottle, 
trimmed it into an oval patch, 
and pressed it over the tear.

Not perfect. But it would have to do.

Just in time, her phone buzzed— 
Wind was coming down the street.

@right: page, image
Kids gathered around the café table, Sophie leaning over the kite, carefully pressing the patch in place.

“Oh, Wind — nice,” Sophie said, 
giving him a quick kiss on the cheek, 
“You’re late.”

“I got stuck,” Wind replied.

“Was there a whooshing sound  
when you made it through a window?”

“Almost!” Wind grinned, 
“They have good stories— 
but the benches are very sticky,
you are fixing a kite?”

Wind looked at the patch.
“A water bottle label— 
we have proper tape at the workshop.”

“I know, but I couldn’t go after skunking out.”

“Right,” Wind said,

“It’s good enough, let’s get it up.”, Sophie said,

They launched again. It lifted, twisted— 
then flopped onto the ground with a pop.

When they've checked, the bottle label flown off.
The left wing was torn in two places.

They gathered around, inspecting the damage.
One of the kids looked close to tears.

“Can you fix it?” one of the kids asked.

Sophie studied the torn wing.
“Wind, can you get the toolbox?”

“Come on. Let's go to the workshop,” Wind said.
“It's there for us. You'll see.”

Sophie felt her face get hot— 
but the kids were waiting.

“Okay,” she said quietly.

They walked back to the church, then around, 
to the community space.

The church was near empty, only a few people.
Some smiled at the kids with the kite.

Sophie felt a little better.
But her Mom was not there.


They've taken the time and repaired the dragon kite,
properly this time, restoring its torn wing.

“There, good as new, it`s a great workshop,” Wind said.
the only thing missing here is ice cream. Come on. 
New place—pistachio.”

Sophie, Wind, and the two kids entering the workshop space, there are many tables, chairs, shelves with art supplies, work benches with tools near the walls.


@comment: hidden
Religions - a self-reinforcing cluster of ideas that functions as information infrastructure: interconnected, useful, math-like in refinement and reliability, and often coupled to a social network that can scale globally and persist for millennia. Stories act as algorithms for living (shaping behavior); prayers focus attention and intent; rituals provide pre-cooked responses; networks spread information and coordinate action; living social stories evolve and stabilize communities. Monotheistic frames reduce noise but trade off diversity via hierarchy. Most of these systems are designed for adults, not children—so they often fail modern kids unless reinterpreted for them.

They ate ice cream.

“Look, Wind — the dragon. They’ve released it,
it’s gliding now,” Sophie said.  

“Yeah, flying free — it looks great,” Wind replied.  
“Love it.”

They walked through the park, 
the dragon kite a bright shape against the sky.

Sophie laughed, remembering. “You should have seen my mom's face 
when I told her Sundays are windier because the sun makes wind, 
and since you're not at school on Sundays, there's more wind around.”

Wind blinked and then laughed, “Wait, you said that?
And she lets you get away with it?  Your parents are too nice. 
I'd be grounded.  But you know, it's the ground that makes wind, so there'd be just more wind around.”
