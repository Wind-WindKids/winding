Sophie and Wind — The Quartet

This is not a story about kingdoms waiting beyond the world. It is a story about children already living in one.

In *Sophie and Wind*, a girl in a Paris garden stumbles into a treasure hunt that awakens her to riddles, wonder, and the first taste of freedom.
In *Sophie and Winter*, she learns to master flight beside a boy who is equal parts friend, teacher, and force of nature — and together they discover joy in discipline and sky.
*Sophie and Ice* darkens the arc: an accident, the onset of puberty, storms of neglect and withdrawal. Even Dragons cannot prevent loss, and Wind learns the bitter edges of loyalty.
Finally, *Sophie and Sun* opens the way forward, as Sophie steps out of a narrative that she had outgrown, and into a freedom as bright as the sky.

This book is a story. You may have strong feelings about it, and that’s good. If you’d like to make your own version, you can: make it Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Feminist, eco-spiritual, secular-humanist — or anti-so. You can even reverse the roles and call it Wind and Sophie.
