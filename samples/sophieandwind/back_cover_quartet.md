Sophie and Wind — The Quartet
This is not a story about kingdoms waiting beyond the world.  
It is a realistic story about children already living in one.  

In *Sophie and Wind*, a girl in a Paris garden stumbles into a treasure hunt that awakens her.  
In *Sophie and Winter*, she learns to master flight beside a boy who is equal parts friend, teacher, and force of nature.  
*Sophie and Ice* darkens the arc: an accident, even Dragons cannot prevent loss, and Wind learns the bitter edges of loyalty.  
Finally, *Sophie and Sun* she steps out of a narrative she had outgrown, and into a freedom as bright as the sky.  

It is a story with a permissive license, and change is easier than you think.  
Swap the order — put *Sun* before *Ice* — to get the old classic arc,  
or even reverse the roles and call it *Wind and Sophie.*
