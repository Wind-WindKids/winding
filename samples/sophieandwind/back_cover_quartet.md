approach - The path an aircraft follows when coming in to land
canopy - The transparent cover over the cockpit, like a windshield in a car
centerline - The painted line running down the middle of a runway
cockpit - The area where the pilot sits and controls the aircraft
control stick - The main control lever the pilot uses to steer the aircraft up, down, left, and right
crosswind - Wind blowing across the runway from the side, making takeoff and landing more challenging
eGull - The electric ultralight aircraft in the story; a small, slow single-seat airplane
glide - Flying without engine power, descending gradually
gusting - When wind speed increases and decreases suddenly
headset - Headphones with a microphone that pilots wear to communicate by radio
level flight - Flying straight and level, maintaining the same altitude
lift - The upward force that keeps aircraft in the air; also rising air currents that gliders use
parallel runways - Two runways that run side by side
Part 103 - U.S. aviation rules that allow ultralight aircraft to be flown without a pilot's license
pattern - The standard rectangular path aircraft fly around an airport when preparing to land
pedals - Foot controls that steer the aircraft left and right on the ground and control the rudder in flight
preflight - The safety inspection done before every flight
ramp - The paved area where aircraft are parked
runway - The long strip of pavement where aircraft take off and land
solo - Flying alone without an instructor
stall warning - When an aircraft flies too slowly and loses lift; the warning sound that alerts the pilot
taxiway - The paths aircraft use to move between the ramp and runway; 
taxi - to taxi means to drive the aircraft on the ground
takeoff roll - The aircraft's acceleration down the runway before leaving the ground
throttle - The control that adjusts engine power
tie-downs - Ropes or straps that secure an aircraft to the ground

Art
The generative AI art in *Sophie and Ice* is not without flaws. If you'd like to illuminate your own version, please visit [wind.kids](https://wind.kids).

Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the many magnificent ones—large and small—who have opened access to their models, technologies, and the modern digital art workshop: a true bicycle-for-the-mind. Without these tools, Sophie and Ice would never have fit within the constraints of everyday life, and simply wouldn’t have been possible.

What began as a bike is now almost a fusion-powered flying dragon for the mind.

With deep gratitude to the creators, scientists, engineers, artists, and dreamers who share their knowledge and imagination with the world. And this story was shaped by those who see, with clear eyes, that the truest republic is already here: in friendship, in learning, in love, and in sunlight.

  - Wind

About the author
The author works at one of the labs where pieces of modern-day magic quietly come together. An active pilot in the past, he still flies some times and finds inspiration in art, flight, technology, and the creative particles that connect them.

Sophie and Wind — The Quartet
Two ordinary kids. A real Dragon. And the orchestra in the sky.

When a Dragon teaches Sophie and Wind to fly ultralight eGulls in California, flying turns out to be the easy part. A bicycle accident in Paris changes everything—and ice creeps between them. They navigate the turbulence of growing up, the rules and kingdoms that try to claim them, and learn that sometimes a simple *Hi* is enough to find their way back to each other.

A story about first flight, first love, and the freedom to write your own rules in the sky. Perfect for readers ages ten and up.
