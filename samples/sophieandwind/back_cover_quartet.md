glide - Flying without engine power, descending gradually
gusting - When wind speed increases and decreases suddenly
headset - Headphones with a microphone that pilots wear to communicate by radio
level flight - Flying straight and level, maintaining the same altitude
lift - The upward force that keeps aircraft in the air; also rising air currents that gliders use
parallel runways - Two runways that run side by side
Part 103 - U.S. aviation rules that allow ultralight aircraft to be flown without a pilot's license
pattern - The standard rectangular path aircraft fly around an airport when preparing to land
pedals - Foot controls that steer the aircraft left and right on the ground and control the rudder in flight
preflight - The safety inspection done before every flight
ramp - The paved area where aircraft are parked
runway - The long strip of pavement where aircraft take off and land
solo - Flying alone without an instructor
stall warning - When an aircraft flies too slowly and loses lift; the warning sound that alerts the pilot
taxiway - The paths aircraft use to move between the ramp and runway;

takeoff roll - The aircraft's acceleration down the runway before leaving the ground
throttle - The control that adjusts engine power

Sophie and Wind — The Quartet
Two ordinary kids. A real Dragon. And the sky.

When a Dragon teaches Sophie and Wind to fly ultralight eGulls in California, flying turns out to be the easy part. A bicycle accident in Paris changes everything—and ice creeps between them. They navigate the turbulence of growing up and learn that sometimes a simple *Hi* is enough and not enough.
