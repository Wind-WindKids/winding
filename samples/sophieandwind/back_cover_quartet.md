Dragon: “Today we are going to study ice in flight.  
And ice in flight is bad news.”  

Wind: “But I don’t need bad news. I want good news.”  

Dragon: “Statistically, if you want good news, you should ditch Sophie.”  

Wind: “Wait… what?”  

Dragon: “When ice is encountered, the rule is simple:  
immediately start working to get out of it.  
No panic. No delay. But no waiting, either.”  

Wind: “You’re talking about wings.”  

Dragon: “I’m talking about Sophie.  
She iced half your world.  
Safe pilots exit the cloud. They don’t cling to it.  
You’d be better off finding a copilot, not a cloud.”  

Wind: “I can move a cloud or two.”  

Dragon: “Clouds move with the fronts, 
some are bound to terrain, remember?”  

Wind: “Touché. But I love clouds. They’re fluffy.”  

Dragon: “Along a front, gray clouds over icy air
can make freezing rain. Deadly.”  

Wind: “I’m not afraid. I can write with clouds in the sky!”  

Dragon: “Brave. But unsafe. At least get equipped.”  

Wind: “With what? Combat pillows? Iron safety boots?”  

Dragon: “With knowledge. Keep watching for every sign of frosting or ice.
The instant you suspect it — start working to get out.”

Wind: “Yeah… not my style.”

“Dad… Dragon says it’d be safer if I ditched Sophie.”

“Dragon loves to keep it safe. 
Is that what you want?”

“No… I don’t want safe. I want to fly with her.”

“Then Dragon’s love is not at all the love you need.”

Art
The generative AI art in *Sophie and Ice* is not without flaws. If you'd like to illuminate your own version, please visit [wind.kids](https://wind.kids).

Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the many magnificent ones—large and small—who have opened access to their models, technologies, and the modern digital art workshop: a true bicycle-for-the-mind. Without these tools, Sophie and Ice would never have fit within the constraints of everyday life, and simply wouldn’t have been possible.

What began as a bike is now almost a fusion-powered flying dragon for the mind.

With deep gratitude to the creators, scientists, engineers, artists, and dreamers who share their knowledge and imagination with the world. And this story was shaped by those who see, with clear eyes, that the truest republic is already here: in friendship, in learning, in love, and in sunlight.

Sophie and Wind — The Quartet
Two ordinary kids. A real Dragon. And the orchestra in the sky.

When a Dragon teaches Sophie and Wind to fly ultralight eGulls in California, flying turns out to be the easy part. A bicycle accident in Paris changes everything—and ice creeps between them. They navigate the turbulence of growing up, the rules and kingdoms that try to claim them, and learn that sometimes a simple *Hi* is enough to find their way back to each other.

A story about first flight, first love, and the freedom to write your own rules in the sky. Perfect for readers ages ten and up.
