Art
The generative AI art in *Sophie and Ice* is not without flaws. If you'd like to illuminate your own version, please visit [wind.kids](https://wind.kids).

Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the many magnificent ones—large and small—who have opened access to their models, technologies, and the modern digital art workshop: a true bicycle-for-the-mind. Without these tools, Sophie and Ice would never have fit within the constraints of everyday life, and simply wouldn’t have been possible.

What began as a bike is now almost a fusion-powered flying dragon for the mind.

With deep gratitude to the creators, scientists, engineers, artists, and dreamers who share their knowledge and imagination with the world. And this story was shaped by those who see, with clear eyes, that the truest republic is already here: in friendship, in learning, in love, and in sunlight.

About the author
The author works at one of the labs where pieces of modern-day magic quietly come together. An active pilot in the past, he still flies some times and finds inspiration in art, flight, technology, and the creative threads that connect them.

Sophie and Wind — The Quartet
This is not a story about kingdoms waiting beyond the world.  
It is a realistic story about children already living in one.  

In *Sophie and Wind*, a girl in a Paris garden stumbles into a treasure hunt that awakens her.  
In *Sophie and Winter*, she learns to master flight beside a boy who is equal parts friend, teacher, and force of nature.  
*Sophie and Frost* darkens the arc: an accident, even Dragons cannot prevent loss, and Wind learns the bitter edges of loyalty in *Wind and Ice*.
Finally, *Sophie and Sun*, she steps out of a narrative she had outgrown, and into a freedom as bright as the sky.  

It is a story with a permissive license, and change is easier than you think.  
Swap the order — put *Sun* before *Ice* — to get the old classic arc,  
or even reverse the roles and call it *Wind and Sophie.*
