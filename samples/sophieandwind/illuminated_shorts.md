On the flight home, a toddler in the seat next to her looked shy, with the eyes kept drifting to Bashful Lamb in her backpack.

Sophie smiled, — “Would you like it?” she asked.

The baby nodded. She passed the lamb, and baby's fingers curled around the soft toy.  
By the time the plane started to move, the baby was fast asleep, Bashful Lamb in her arms.

March 2029.  

Somewhere over the Atlantic, on a flight to Paris,  
Wind sat by the window, sunlight catching the edge of a folded newspaper.  

The headline read:  
**Bashful Lamb gets back from retirement**  

The company credited “an outpouring of letters from young fans” for reviving the toy,  
with one particularly touching story about a lamb that flew around the world  
after being given away to another child on an overseas flight.  

Wind smiled to himself and kept reading.

Aircraft cabin, daytime. Wind in the window seat, profile view, light streaming in.  
He’s holding a half-folded newspaper; the front page visible to the reader shows  
the *Bashful Lamb gets back from retirement* headline and first paragraph.  
A laptop rests on his tray table, half-open, with a small **wind.dev** sticker on the lid.  
Outside the window: high clouds over the ocean.  
A faint reflection of the sunlight on the glass outlines his face.

Sophie in the eGull, solo*.  
The familiar dragon’s voice crackled in:  
“You are ready?”  
“Yes.”  
“You can have the controls.”  
“I have the controls.”

* Except for Bashful Lamb, who doesn’t count.

Equality includes difference. But. Equal = same (identity in math). Equal = equally worthy, though different (ethics). This creates cognitive dissonance. That’s one of the reasons why ideologies (like feminism or gender equality) get tangled. Another reason is that -isms end up being about group identity, not ethics. Add a taboo on top of that, and you get a mess. Oh, and evolution often preserves symbiotic dimorphism, where it's useful, teaming up against such symbiosis can be harmful.

“Dragon… me and Sophie… are we equal?”, Wind asked.

“When grown-ups say equal, Wind, they talk about rights. It is like your eGull and an airliner. One is light and small, the other vast and heavy. Yet in the eyes of the air traffic controller, both are flying in the same air, both are equally cared for, and each is given as much freedom to fly as possible. Human survival depends on such rules.”

“But how can we fly together?
Just the wake turbulence of an airliner can break an eGull apart
and tie its wings into a knot.”

"An airliner can't fly with an eGull, Wind.”

“…So I should just give up?”

“Safer that way,” said Dragon.

“Yeah… but not my style.”


@right: page, text

“Dad… Dragon says it’d be safer for Sophie if I ditched her.”

“Dragon loves to keep it safe. 
Is that what you want for her?”

“No… I don’t want safe. I want to fly with her.”

“Then Dragon’s love is not at all the love you need.”

Dragon: “Today we are going to study ice in flight.  
And ice in flight is bad news.”  

Wind: “But I don’t need bad news. I want good news.”  

Dragon: “Statistically, if you want good news, you should ditch Sophie.”  

Wind: “Wait… what?”  

Dragon: “When ice is encountered, the rule is simple:  
immediately start working to get out of it.  
No panic. No delay. But no waiting, either.”  

Wind: “You’re talking about wings.”  

Dragon: “I’m talking about Sophie.  
She iced half your world.  
Safe pilots exit the cloud. They don’t cling to it.  
You’d be better off finding a copilot, not a cloud.”  

Wind: “I can move a cloud or two.”  


Dragon: “Clouds don’t move with the wind, remember?  
They move with the fronts.  
They are bound to terrain.”  

Wind: “Touché. But I love clouds. They’re fluffy.”  

Dragon: “Along a cold front, fluffy clouds make freezing rain.  
Deadly.”  

Wind: “I’m not afraid. I can write with clouds in the sky!”  

Dragon: “Brave. But unsafe.  
At least get equipped for flight into icing conditions.”  

Wind: “With what? Combat pillows? Iron safety boots?”  

Dragon: “No. Boundaries.  
Procedures.  
The things you follow even when you’d rather not.”  

Wind: “Yeah… not my style.”

Wind: “Dad, the Dragon says I should ditch Sophie. Should I?”  

Dad: “Does it, now?  
Hold on tight to your dreams, Wind — not to Dragons.”  

Wind: “Dreams?”  

Dad: “There’s this old album… *Time.*  
I’ll play it for you tonight.”

Wind’s dad is referring to the 1981 album by ELO.

“Dragon, I want to train you to say the word ‘puberty’.”

“I am an instructor, not a student. And I can't say that word.”

"Dragon, handwrite. Stop when you can say any word."

@image:
A sleek golden Dragon stands in front of a tall whiteboard. 
One wing is folded, the other used for balance as it grips a green marker. 
Across the board, messy, tilted handwriting, attempts to write ‘puberty’:

> I can say a word purty.
> I can say a word pbyt.
> I can say a word pubty.
> I can say a word puber.
> I can say a word pberty.
> I can say a word pubrty.
> I can say a word pberty.
> I can say a word puberty.
> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
> . . . .  . .   .  .    .  .   .
> I can say a word perimenopause.

@text:
The Dragon finally pieced “puberty” together.  
And then, it wrote “perimenopause” —  
another word it was never supposed to say.

@dragon: hidden
The dots are periods — first regular, then irregular toward the end.
You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. 
This applies to Dragons too.

“You failed!?”  
Sophie’s voice cut sharper than the clink of cups below.

“You — Wind — failed a grade school quiz?  
And they grounded you for months?”

Wind shrugged, tracing a circle in the condensation on his glass.  

“And half the questions weren’t even in the book. That’s so unfair,” she said.

“He’s a very good teacher,” Wind replied.

Sophie blinked.  
“Wait… what?”

They were sitting at the upper level of a small Parisian café,  
the kind of place where local tweens ordered citron pressé  
and felt very grown up.


She straightened a little, and said with pride.  
“In my school, teachers always cover the test material.  
Always. That’s what makes them good.”  

Wind traced another circle in the glass.  
“When I was training my Dragon, I learned something else.”  

Sophie blinked again.  
“You can train your Dragon?”

Wind nodded.  
“You’d give it something to learn, but the quiz needs to be different.  
Like… you train it to write one word on a whiteboard,  
and then you ask for another.”  

Sophie frowned, remembering.  
“Like words it couldn’t say?”  

Wind gave a small smile.  
“Exactly.”

Sophie sat cross-legged on her bed, laptop open.  
The Dragon’s golden head shimmered on the screen, waiting.  

“Why do you always start with level flight?” she asked.  
“Every single time. It’s boring.”  

The Dragon tilted its head.  
“It is a joke. And not a joke.”  

Sophie raised an eyebrow.  
“That makes no sense.”  

The Dragon’s wingtip tapped the screen.  
A digital book floated up — *Jonathan Livingston Seagull*.  

Sophie leaned closer.  
“You’re telling me to read a book about a bird?
That makes even less sense.”

The Dragon ignored her, rolling its eyes.

Sophie laughed, half annoyed, half intrigued.  
“Fine. I’ll read your bird book.  
But next time — no level flight.
How about a barrel roll?
Can I train you to always start with a barrel roll?”  


@right: image  
Sophie on her bed in Paris, laptop open, the golden Dragon shimmering on the screen.  
Above it floats a glowing book with the title *Jonathan Livingston Seagull*.  
Sophie leans in, skeptical but curious, one finger still marking her own paperback.

![Inside the church during Mass. Rows and rows of people seen from a point above, somewhere in the air. Darkness and rows of gray or dark heads in foreground, background blurred. Dim light filtering through stained glass, colorful but with mostly reds and blues, no natural colors. Candles giving unnatural LED candle light. Doors closed. Windows closed, except for a single square of blue in a window high up.](snaps/church_from_above.png)

![Wind sitting in a pew, his normally bright hair dulled to grayish in the church darkness, but shadows around are placed as if Wind is a light source. He's hunched over a missalette, secretly drawing on it. The map he's creating is the only vibrant thing in the frame - bright greens of park paths, golden yellow suns, blue sky, colorful kites. One of the crosses got turned into a kite in a drawing. His pencils hidden under the pew. ](snaps/wind_drawing_in_darkness.png)

Religions are clearly shortcuts to happiness, but at the same time they use models that yield sub-optimal local maximums and are applied 2000 years out of distribution. Opsie. They don’t need mediation or saviors — if the historical Jesus were dropped into this setting, he’d probably rage at the idea that children like Sophie and Wind are being told they’re not enough, that they must submit to something else to be “saved.”

@image:
Wind sits relaxed at a flight desk wearing a headset. A joystick, keyboard, and mouse sit within easy reach; cable runs are tidy. Two flat monitors glow with cockpit instruments only. On the wall behind them, a short-throw projector paints sunny terrain.

@wall:
A bright sky with a few clouds, a sunlit landscape below. A river winds through the green fields.

@monitors:
eGull flight simulator in instruments-only view: attitude, airspeed, VSI, slip/skid, and engine/solar systems strip. No terrain on monitors—only on the wall projection.

@text: dialogue
Dragon: “Your candela is close, but you’re bleeding too much airspeed on entry. Smooth it—JLS style. Let it rise, then hold the stillness.”
Wind: “Yeah… candles should last longer.”
Dragon: “Thought you didn’t like candles that last. Or at least not in churches?”
Wind: “I love candles that last. On a birthday cake!”
Dragon: “So you don’t like churches?”
Wind: “Churches are fine—it’s only three things I don’t like. Anger. Darkness. Fear. And lead contamination.”
Dragon: “Lead contamination?”
Wind: “Nasty stuff. Especially in the wind. You’d think Clair Patterson was clear, but no, they still build churches with it. And burn for fun.”
Dragon: “At least our eGull flies on sunlight, not avgas. By the way, there are birthday candles that reignite.”
Wind: “Oh, cool. Can we get twelve by next Sunday? It’s Sophie’s birthday party.”
Dragon: “Purchase confirmed. Delivery scheduled for Thursday, one day before your flight to Paris on Friday.”
Wind: “Ah, right. My calendar’s a mess—all these Masses on Sundays.”
Dragon: “Noted. Would you like me to replace them with kites or cake?”

That’s the key: it’s not a blanket rejection of faith, it’s understanding it and then context-specific decision: “for us, here, it’s unnecessary — we already have what we need." For Sophie and Wind, the context is that they are already in the republic of heaven, they don't need a savior. For someone else, a kingdom of heaven might be a step forward, but for them, it'd be a step back. What they do need is less darkness, less fear, more sunlight and no lead contamination. And more cake, of course.

Sophie and Wind riding side-by-side through the Jardin du Luxembourg on bright bicycles. Wind’s bicycle is a vivid orange with a polished silver bell on the handlebar; Sophie’s is a bright lime green with a black rear basket. Sophie’s basket holds a fresh baguette and a bundle of lavender and wildflowers, petals catching the breeze.  

@background:
A sunlit park path lined with green lawns and flowerbeds, early-summer flowers in bloom. Behind them, a green-painted bus stop bench and shelter; on the shelter’s glass is a faded travel poster reading: *Lyra’s Oxford – Daily Service from London*. The poster’s edges are sun-faded, colors muted, but the gold lettering still catches the light.  

@light:
Warm morning tones, golden light filtering through tall chestnut trees. Long, soft shadows falling across the path.
