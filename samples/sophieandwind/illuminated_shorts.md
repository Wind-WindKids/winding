On the flight home, a toddler in the seat next to her looked shy, with the eyes kept drifting to Bashful Lamb in her backpack.

Sophie smiled, — “Would you like it?” she asked.

The baby nodded. She passed the lamb, and baby's fingers curled around the soft toy.  
By the time the plane started to move, the baby was fast asleep, Bashful Lamb in her arms.

March 2029.  

Somewhere over the Atlantic, on a flight to Paris,  
Wind sat by the window, sunlight catching the edge of a folded newspaper.  

The headline read:  
**Bashful Lamb gets back from retirement**  

The company credited “an outpouring of letters from young fans” for reviving the toy,  
with one particularly touching story about a lamb that flew around the world  
after being given away to another child on an overseas flight.  

Wind smiled to himself and kept reading.

Aircraft cabin, daytime. Wind in the window seat, profile view, light streaming in.  
He’s holding a half-folded newspaper; the front page visible to the reader shows  
the *Bashful Lamb gets back from retirement* headline and first paragraph.  
A laptop rests on his tray table, half-open, with a small **wind.dev** sticker on the lid.  
Outside the window: high clouds over the ocean.  
A faint reflection of the sunlight on the glass outlines his face.

Sophie in the eGull, solo*.  
The familiar dragon’s voice crackled in:  
“You are ready?”  
“Yes.”  
“You can have the controls.”  
“I have the controls.”  

@note: text, small, italic
* Except for Bashful Lamb, who doesn’t count.
