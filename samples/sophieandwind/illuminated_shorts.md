On the flight home, a toddler in the seat next to her looked shy, with the eyes kept drifting to Bashful Lamb in her backpack.

Sophie smiled, — “Would you like it?” she asked.

The baby nodded. She passed the lamb, and baby's fingers curled around the soft toy.  
By the time the plane started to move, the baby was fast asleep, Bashful Lamb in her arms.

March 2029.  

Somewhere over the Atlantic, on a flight to Paris,  
Wind sat by the window, sunlight catching the edge of a folded newspaper.  

The headline read:  
**Bashful Lamb gets back from retirement**  

The company credited “an outpouring of letters from young fans” for reviving the toy,  
with one particularly touching story about a lamb that flew around the world  
after being given away to another child on an overseas flight.  

Wind smiled to himself and kept reading.

Aircraft cabin, daytime. Wind in the window seat, profile view, light streaming in.  
He’s holding a half-folded newspaper; the front page visible to the reader shows  
the *Bashful Lamb gets back from retirement* headline and first paragraph.  
A laptop rests on his tray table, half-open, with a small **wind.dev** sticker on the lid.  
Outside the window: high clouds over the ocean.  
A faint reflection of the sunlight on the glass outlines his face.

Equality includes difference. But. Equal = same (identity in math). Equal = equally worthy, though different (ethics). This creates cognitive dissonance. That’s one of the reasons why ideologies (like feminism or gender equality) get tangled. Another reason is that -isms end up being about group identity, not ethics. Add a taboo on top of that, and you get a mess. Oh, and evolution often preserves symbiotic dimorphism, where it's useful, teaming up against such symbiosis can be harmful.

“Dragon… me and Sophie… are we equal?”, Wind asked.

“When grown-ups say equal, Wind, they talk about rights. It is like your eGull and an airliner. One is light and small, the other vast and heavy. Yet in the eyes of the air traffic controller, both are flying in the same air, both are equally cared for, and each is given as much freedom to fly as possible. Human survival depends on such rules.”

“But how can we fly together?
Just the wake turbulence of an airliner can break an eGull apart
and tie its wings into a knot.”

"An airliner can't fly with an eGull, Wind.”

“…So I should just give up?”

“Safer that way,” said Dragon.

“Yeah… but not my style.”


@right: page, text

“Dad… Dragon says it’d be safer for Sophie if I ditched her.”

“Dragon loves to keep it safe. 
Is that what you want for her?”

“No… I don’t want safe. I want to fly with her.”

“Then Dragon’s love is not at all the love you need.”

Ditch Sophie

Dragon: “Today we are going to study ice in flight.  
And ice in flight is bad news.”  

Wind: “But I don’t need bad news. I want good news.”  

Dragon: “Statistically, if you want good news, you should ditch Sophie.”  

Wind: “Wait… what?”  

Dragon: “When ice is encountered, the rule is simple:  
immediately start working to get out of it.  
No panic. No delay. But no waiting, either.”  

Wind: “You’re talking about wings.”  

Dragon: “I’m talking about Sophie.  
She iced half your world.  
Safe pilots exit the cloud. They don’t cling to it.  
You’d be better off finding a copilot, not a cloud.”  

Wind: “I can move a cloud or two.”  

Dragon: “Clouds move with the fronts, 
some are bound to terrain, remember?”  

Wind: “Touché. But I love clouds. They’re fluffy.”  

Dragon: “Along a front, gray clouds over icy air
can make freezing rain. Deadly.”  

Wind: “I’m not afraid. I can write with clouds in the sky!”  

Dragon: “Brave. But unsafe. At least get equipped.”  

Wind: “With what? Combat pillows? Iron safety boots?”  

Dragon: “With knowledge. Keep watching for every sign of frosting or ice.
The instant you suspect it — start working to get out.”

Wind: “Yeah… not my style.”

“Dragon, I want to train you to say the word ‘puberty’.”

“I am an instructor, not a student. And I can't say that word.”

"Dragon, handwrite. Stop when you can say any word."

@image:
A sleek golden Dragon stands in front of a tall whiteboard.  It looks like it's made out of golden stars and lines, fake cgi in watercolor.
Across the board, messy, tilted handwriting, attempts to write ‘puberty’:

> I can say a word purty.
> I can say a word pbyt.
> I can say a word pubty.
> I can say a word puber.
> I can say a word pberty.
> I can say a word pubrty.
> I can say a word pberty.
> I can say a word puberti.
> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
> . . . .  . .   .  .    .  .   .
> I can say a word perimenopause.



@comment: hidden
The Dragon finally pieced “puberty” together.  
And then, it wrote “perimenopause” —  
another word it was never supposed to say.

@dragon: hidden
The dots are periods — first regular, then irregular toward the end.
You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. 
This applies to Dragons too.

“You failed!?”  
Sophie’s voice cut sharper than the clink of cups below.

“You — Wind — failed a grade school quiz?  
And they grounded you for months?”

Wind shrugged, tracing a circle in the condensation on his glass.  

“And half the questions weren’t even in the book. That’s so unfair,” she said.

“He’s a very good teacher,” Wind replied.

Sophie blinked.  
“Wait… what?”

They were sitting at the upper level of a small Parisian café,  
the kind of place where local tweens ordered citron pressé  
and felt very grown up.


She straightened a little, and said with pride.  
“In my school, teachers always cover the test material.  
Always. That’s what makes them good.”  

Wind traced another circle in the glass.  
“When I was training my Dragon, I learned something else.”  

Sophie blinked again.  
“You can train your Dragon?”

Wind nodded.  
“You’d give it something to learn, but the quiz needs to be different.  
Like… you train it to write one word on a whiteboard,  
and then you ask for another.”  

Sophie frowned, remembering.  
“Like words it couldn’t say?”  

Wind gave a small smile.  
“Exactly.”

Sophie sat cross-legged on her bed, laptop open.  
The Dragon’s golden head shimmered on the screen, waiting.  

“Why do you always start with level flight?” she asked.  
“Every single time. It’s boring.”  

The Dragon tilted its head.  
“It is a joke. And not a joke.”  

Sophie raised an eyebrow.  
“That makes no sense.”  

The Dragon’s wingtip tapped the screen.  
A digital book floated up — *Jonathan Livingston Seagull*.  

Sophie leaned closer.  
“You’re telling me to read a book about a bird?
That makes even less sense.”

The Dragon ignored her, rolling its eyes.

Sophie laughed, half annoyed, half intrigued.  
“Fine. I’ll read your bird book.  
But next time — no level flight.
How about a barrel roll?
Can I train you to always start with a barrel roll?”

Religions are clearly shortcuts to happiness, but at the same time they use models that yield sub-optimal local maximums and are applied 2000 years out of distribution. Opsie. They don’t need mediation or saviors — if the historical Jesus were dropped into this setting, he’d probably rage at the idea that children like Sophie and Wind are being told they’re not enough, that they must submit to something else to be “saved.”

Wind: “I love candles that last. On a birthday cake!”
Dragon: “So you don’t like churches?”
Wind: “It’s only three things I don’t like. Anger. Darkness. Fear. And lead contamination.”
Dragon: “Lead contamination?”
Wind: “Nasty stuff. Especially in the wind. You’d think Clair Patterson was clear, but no, they still build with it. And burn for fun.”
Dragon: “At least our eGull flies on sunlight, not avgas. By the way, there are birthday candles that reignite.”
Wind: “Oh, cool. Can we get twelve by next Sunday? It’s Sophie’s birthday party.”
Dragon: “Purchase confirmed. Delivery scheduled for Thursday, one day before your flight to Paris on Friday.”
Wind: “Ah, right. My Sundays calendar’s a mess—all these Masses are interfering.”
Dragon: “Noted. Would you like me to replace ithem with kites or cake?”


@comment: author, hidden
That’s the key: it’s not a blanket rejection of faith, it’s understanding it and then context-specific decision: “for us, here, it’s unnecessary — we already have what we need." For Sophie and Wind, the context is that they are already in the republic of heaven, they don't need a savior. For someone else, a kingdom of heaven might be a step forward, but for them, it'd be a step back. What they do need is less darkness, less fear, more sunlight and no lead contamination. And more cake, of course.

@left: page, text
The next week at the kite workshop, 
Sophie handed out papers.
On each was a drawing of kites, some light, 
some heavy, some with torn sails.

She explained the quiz:

Circle the kites that will fly the best, 
Cross out the ones that will not. 
Use aspect ratio, balance, and weight.
Two minutes to solve it all.  

One kid squinted at the page, hand shooting up.  
“This isn’t fair! We’ve never covered aspect ratio.”  

“It’s in the syllabus, between lines six and seven,”
she replied, not looking up.

Wind, helping with the workshop, 
almost laughed. He’d heard that line before.

Sophie’s handout.

Circle the kites that will fly the best, 
Cross out the ones that will not.

Two minutes to solve it all.  


@image:  
A spread with a watercolor illustration of a park scene,
on the grass there are six kites, numbered 1 to 6.

1. A light carbon fiber cross shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:2.
2. A light carbon fiber diamond shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:1.
3. A light carbon fiber square shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:1.
4. A heavy cross shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:2, with a thick wooden frame.
5. A heavy diamond shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:1, with a thick wooden frame.
6. A heavy square shaped kite, aspect ratio 1:1, with a thick wooden frame.

A few other kites are scattered around, not numbered, some with a torn sail, some with missing tails.

Same handout as before, 
but with a thick line added to #4,
to make the cross kite look like a "4" —
And then that kite is crossed out.

@text: big, red, mark
17%

@text: margin, note, small, red, handwritten
Review aspect ratio, weight and balance.

@comment: hidden
The kite that will fly the best is #2, the light carbon fiber diamond kite with an aspect ratio of 1:1.
The rest will not fly the best or will not fly at all, due to their suboptimal weight and balance or aspect ratio.
The correct answer is to circle #2, cross out #1, #3, #4, #5, and #6. The student crossed out #4.
One correct, 1/6 = 0.166666… ≈ 16.67%. Rounded up to 17%. 

@dragon: hidden
A heavy kite, shaped like a cross, cannot rise.
A line turns it into a “4,” a number of death.
Crossed out again, death itself is negated.

The learner earns only 17%, a failing mark.
Yet in the fractions behind it, 666 turns to 667.

Once, I lived at 667 Eden,
and then came Sophie.

| Light |  1    |   2     |   3    |
| Heavy |  4    |   5     |   6    |

The top row: light frames — they would fly.
The diamond kite would fly best, balanced and right aspect ratio for the kite.
Correct answer is to circle #2, cross out #1, #3, #4, #5, and #6.

Something lit up in her mind.  
Wind.  
A name.

but whose name she did not know.

She stepped closer, looked at him, 
smiled, and said:

Once upon a time, 
there was a girl named Ariane. 

She liked to climb onto the stone head of a dragon!

One day her father asked her, 
“Have you tried talking to that dragon?” 

Ariane laughed. She was six, old enough to know. 
“Don’t be silly, Papa. Stone dragons don’t talk,” she said. 

“Let’s try anyway,” he said with a smile.

From his pocket he drew a small box,

The box was empty, yet he pinched the air inside 
and sprinkled something onto the dragon’s head. 

The box was still empty.

Amazingly, even though the dragon hadn't changed, it replied right away:
