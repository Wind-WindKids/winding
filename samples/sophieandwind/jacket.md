Sophie and Wind — The Quartet

A story of awakening, mastery, loss, and liberation. It asks what it means to grow up in a kingdom of technology, systems, stories, and saviors — and what it means to see, with clear eyes, that the truest republic is already here: in friendship, in learning, in love, and in sunlight.

Sophie and Wind — The Quartet

This is not a story about kingdoms waiting beyond the world. It is a story about children already living in one.

In Sophie and Wind, a girl in a Paris garden stumbles into a treasure hunt that awakens her to riddles, wonder, and the first taste of freedom. In Sophie and Winter, she learns to master flight beside a boy who is equal parts friend, teacher, and force of nature — and together they discover joy in discipline and sky. Sophie and Ice darkens the arc: an accident, the onset of puberty, storms of neglect and withdrawal. Even Dragons cannot prevent loss, and Wind learns the bitter edges of loyalty. Finally, Sophie and Sun opens the way forward, as Sophie steps out of narrative that never fit her life, and into a freedom as bright as the sky.

The quartet as a whole is about awakening, mastery, loss, and liberation. It asks what it means to grow up in a kingdom of technology, systems, stories, and saviors — and what it means to recognize, with clear eyes, that the truest republic is already here: in friendship, in learning, in love, and in sunlight.

Sophie and Wind — The Quartet

This is not a story about kingdoms waiting beyond the world. It is a story about children already living in one.

In *Sophie and Wind*, a girl in a Paris garden stumbles into a treasure hunt that awakens her to riddles, wonder, and the first taste of freedom.
In *Sophie and Winter*, she learns to master flight beside a boy who is equal parts friend, teacher, and force of nature — and together they discover joy in discipline and sky.
*Sophie and Ice* darkens the arc: an accident, the onset of puberty, storms of neglect and withdrawal. Even Dragons cannot prevent loss, and Wind learns the bitter edges of loyalty.
Finally, *Sophie and Sun* opens the way forward, as Sophie steps out of a narrative that never fit her life, and into a freedom as bright as the sky.

This book is a story. You may have strong feelings about it, and that’s good. If you’d like to make your own version, you can: make it Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Feminist, eco-spiritual, secular-humanist — or anti-so. You can even reverse the roles and call it Wind and Sophie.

This is a work of fiction; the technologies depicted are plausible in 2025, but nothing here is a flight manual. Flying is only rewarding when risks are properly managed, with qualified instruction and within the
regulations of your country. While Part 103 in the US allows ultralight flight without a license or minimum age, ultralight pilots must receive training and follow all regulations. Always fly safely.





It is a story with a permissive license, and change is easier than you think.  
Swap the order — put *Sun* before *Ice* — to get the old classic arc,  
or even reverse the roles and call it *Wind and Sophie.*
