Sophie and Wind â€” The Quartet

@image:
Sophie sitting on a wooden park bench. She wears large, headphones and looks at her phone, smiling slightly. Leaves drift around her, and small birds and flowers surround the scene, creating a gentle, whimsical atmosphere. In the background, the Eiffel Tower rises through a light mist, and a red-orange kite flies in the sky.

@headphones:
Primarily turquoise blue with peachy-orange ear pads and a yellow-gold accent ring around the pads. The cord is also turquoise.

@phone:
muted teal blue, closely matching the color of her headphones. It's a simple, modern smartphone design with clean edges. there's no visible logo or brand name.

Two laptops in the grass, side by side, kite logo on one of the laptops, next to the keyboard. Complex futuristic dragon airplane CAD 3D graphics on the screen of one of the laptops. Code on another side. In the background, Sophie reads a book, slightly smiling, Eiffel Tower in the distance.

Just like me.

Two birds, facing each other, with a heart between them. The birds are inside the shape of a heart, with the tails forming the top of the heart.
