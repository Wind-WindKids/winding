Sophie and Frost

Sophie slipped.  
She looked away for a moment,
and the world went sideways. 
It tilted, handlebars wrenched.
Then—ice, sky, asphalt—flashed in a cold whirl.

Wind was there. He dropped his bike, ran to her—  
both their phones already calling for help,  
sending location, vitals, and alerts into the air.

A bright, slick machine dropped from the sky.  
rotors whining, buffeting the air.  
Blood on her helmet.  
Hands lifted her away.  
Wind helped—  
and the machine rose, carrying her off.  
Without him.

He stood there, watching.  
And the city was quiet again.  
A baby cried.  
Café voices drifted in.

He called her right away.  
No reply.

Next day he saw her.  
It was a broken rib and she felt fine.

They’d been planning to go skiing next week,  
and they still went to the mountains.  
But the mood wasn’t there.  
They took it easy, wandering the snowy streets,  
lingering in warm cafés,  
breathing the thin, bright air.

Wind saw she was still in pain from the broken rib.  
She smiled when he spoke,  
but the smile didn’t quite reach her eyes.

He felt something was wrong.
But it would be months before he understood  
that something else had been hurt that day,  
something no one could protect.

This time they were flying to California together.
Sophie wanted to study at Wind’s school,
and arrangements had been made for her to spend a semester there.
She thought she could be like Wind,
who spent half the year in France with his mom
and the winter in California with his dad.

It was a cold day when they landed in California.
Rare snow dusted the hills,
and the air carried a bite it almost never had.

Somehow, it felt like a touch of ice
from that day in Paris.

“I thought it was supposed to be sunny here,”
Sophie said the moment they stepped outside.

Wind laughed. Sophie smiled too and they hugged.

But the chill stayed,
as if it had followed her
all the way from Paris.

They started the new semester together.
Classes, homework.

Most days felt ordinary,
but Sophie’s flight training was moving fast.
She had passed her tests and earned her solo —
the Dragon still watching over her.

Now they would take two eGulls into the air,
practicing side by side, 
or chasing lift in the hills that started to turn green.

On Sunday the fog had burned off by mid-morning.  
Two white eGulls sat ready on the field, canopies glinting.

Wind settled into his eGull, headset snug, checklists complete.  
In the second eGull, Sophie did the same, the sunlight playing in her hair.

The Dragons came alive together.  
Wind eased the throttle forward. 
The eGull rolled, lifted, and the horizon dropped away.  
On the parallel runway, Sophie climbed alongside.

@eGull: aircraft, electric, white 
A sleek ultralight electric aircraft, high-wing monoplane, tricycle landing gear. A bubble canopy for a single pilot. Engine is small, sleek and aerodynamic. High T-tail. The fuselage is short and smooth, tapering to the tail, giving it a light, glider-like look.

They cleared the hills, free of the tower.

“Shall we begin with level flight?” 
said Sophie’s Dragon, warmly — just like before.

But Sophie’s voice cut in, sharp and sudden:  
“Stop saying that! I know how to fly level!”

The Dragon spoke softly, as if to itself: “Copy that.”

holding the control stick with her right hand.

The next day, they lined up on the parallel runways again — “This is a tricky one,” — Wind said, “but you can do it.”

She lowered her canopy and started her checklist.

“Crosswind from your right, seven knots, gusting to ten,” her Dragon advised, calm and clear.
“I’ve got it,” Sophie replied, eyes fixed ahead.

Sophie’s eGull began its takeoff roll, nosewheel jittering against the gusts.
A gust hit, hard. The eGull veered left, overcorrected right.

“Abort the takeoff—Abort now—” her Dragon’s voice was quick now, firm.
But Sophie kept chasing the centerline. Another gust — stronger, the right wing lifted.
Nose yawed, the eGull, still on the ground started to roll on one wheel.

Sophie’s eGull, high-wing monoplane, on a runway, roll before take off, view from behind — the eGull is rolling away, right wing slightly higher than left, right wheel off the ground. It is not dramatic.

Her Dragon’s voice cut in, calm but absolute, "I’m taking control now.”
Full rudder, full aileron — the eGull steadied, straightened, slowed, and rolled to a stop in the middle of the runway, dead straight.

Wind was already in the air, "Are you okay?" — he asked over the radio.

Sophie sat rigid, her hand locked on the stick.  
She clicked the transmit.  
“I’m fine,” she said through clenched teeth, — "Aborted takeoff."

It wasn’t the gusts that had scared her most — 
it was the Dragon taking control.

Wind landed, taxied over and came to hug her.

She was not sure what came over her.

That night, she took out her journal.  
Sophie had an idea that she should work  
on relationships and ask for help and support.

She wrote:  
“Today we went flying and I almost died.  
The Dragon never even said sorry. 
And Wind thought it was my own mistake.”

She prayed a little, for help and support.
Then flipped back through a few pages.  
They were filled with her worst memories —  
arguments, accidents, hurts.  

She had never thought  
to write down any of the best ones.  
Or that the Dragon had given her the freedom  
to learn and make mistakes while it was still safe.  

By morning she’d decided: *she was done with Wind*.

The next day the eGull was ready to fly again, but Sophie never came back to the cockpit.
Her headset gathered dust in the hangar, the eGull sat silent.

She still saw Wind, but only on the ground — in cafés, on bike rides, in the park.
The sky no longer seemed to call her.

While Wind was out at the airfield, she’d found a different routine.
She liked the library and an old stone church with the crooked bell tower and the smell of wax.

When he asked why, she just shrugged.
“I like it here. It’s quiet.”

Her voice was gentle, but there was a stillness in it.
Wind tried to understand, but he couldn’t.

One bright Sunday, Wind found her in the park, sitting on a stone bench with a book in her lap.

“Hey,” Wind said, dropping his bike beside the bench.
“Forecast’s perfect. No wind, clear skies. Let’s take the eGulls out.”

Sophie didn’t look up. She turned a page, eyes scanning the text.
“I’m busy.”

“You can read after, no? The eGulls are ready. We can fly together.”

“I said I’m busy, Wind.”
Her voice was flat, without the old teasing edge.

“Hey,” he said, sitting down beside her  
and pulling her into a hug.

Her eyes stayed on the page.
 *“Don’t touch me.”*

Her voice wasn’t angry — just cold.
She stood and walked to the far side of the park without looking back.

Her book was still open, face down where she’d left it.
The echo of her words stayed in the air —  
like a touch of frost to his heart.
He tried to breathe and couldn’t.

He went to the airfield anyway,

The sky was clear, air crisp and still, the kind of day they used to race for.
Wind rolled the eGull out alone, the hangar echoing in a way it never had before.

His Dragon ran the preflight in calm, familiar tones.
Everything was in the green. The wings caught the sunlight just right.
Perfect conditions.

He took off, climbing into the bright air.
The hills spread below, green giving way to blue.

But the other eGull sat silent in its hangar, Sophie’s headset untouched.
No voice in his ear teasing him, no laughter over the channel when they caught lift.

He flew the pattern, landed smooth, taxied in.
The Dragon said, “Nice flight.”

Wind nodded, but didn’t answer.
Without Sophie, it wasn’t flying.
It was just… being in the air.

departure: page, text

Sophie didn’t come to the airfield again.
Two days later, she flew back to Paris and was gone.

Wind tried calling. No answer.
He sent a message. It was read, but no reply.
He tried again. 

"Sophie, are you okay?" he typed, hoping for a response.
Nothing.

Epilogue — Back to Paris

When Sophie got back to Paris, 
her parents were waiting.

They hugged her, relieved.
She felt safe, and warm again.

But something had changed.
She dreamed of flying, and of Wind.
And sometimes she woke up crying,
like a seagull trapped in ice.
