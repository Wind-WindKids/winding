Part 2
Sophie and Frost

Sophie slipped.  
She looked away for a moment,
and the world went sideways. 
It tilted, handlebars wrenched.
Then—ice, sky, asphalt—flashed in a cold whirl.

Wind was there. He dropped his bike, ran to her —  
called the emergency number.

A bright vehicle came quickly,
as if dropped from the sky.  

Wind helped — hands lifted her away,  
and the vehicle left, carrying her off.  
Without him.

He stood there, watching.  
And the city was quiet again.  
A baby cried.  
Café voices drifted in.

He called her right away.  
No reply.

Next day he saw her.  
It was a broken rib and she felt fine.

They’d been planning to go skiing next week,  
and they still went to the mountains.  
But the mood wasn’t there.  
They took it easy, wandering the snowy streets,  
lingering in warm cafés,  
breathing the thin, bright air.

Wind saw she was still in pain from the broken rib.  
She smiled when he spoke,  
but the smile didn’t quite reach her eyes.

He felt something was wrong.
But it would be months before he understood
that it wasn’t only her rib that fractured,
but something unseen between them as well.

This time they were flying to California together.
Sophie wanted to study at Wind’s school,
and arrangements had been made for her to spend a semester there.
She thought she could be like Wind,
who spent half the year in France with his mom
and the winter in California with his dad.

It was a cold day when they landed in California.
Rare snow dusted the hills,
and the air carried a bite it almost never had.

Somehow it felt like a touch of ice
from that day in Paris.

“I thought it was supposed to be sunny here,”
Sophie said the moment they stepped outside.

Wind laughed. She did too, and they hugged.

But the chill stayed,
as if it had followed her
all the way from Paris.

They started the new semester together.
Classes, homework.

Most days felt ordinary,
but Sophie’s flight training was moving fast.
She had passed her tests and earned her solo —
the Dragon still watching over her.

Now they would take two eGulls into the air,
practicing side by side, 
or chasing lift in the hills that started to turn green.

On Sunday the fog had burned off by mid-morning.  
Two white eGulls sat ready on the field, canopies glinting.

Wind settled into his eGull, headset snug, checklists complete.  
In the second eGull, Sophie did the same, the sunlight playing in her hair.

The Dragons came alive together.  
Wind eased the throttle forward. 
The eGull rolled, lifted, and the horizon dropped away.  
On the parallel runway, Sophie climbed alongside.

A sleek ultralight electric aircraft, high-wing monoplane, tricycle landing gear. A bubble canopy for a single pilot. Engine is small, sleek and aerodynamic. High T-tail. The fuselage is short and smooth, tapering to the tail, giving it a light, glider-like look.

They cleared the hills, free of the tower.

“Shall we begin with level flight?” 
said Sophie’s Dragon, warmly — just like before.

But Sophie’s voice cut in, sharp and sudden:  
“Stop saying that! I know how to fly level!”

The Dragon spoke softly, as if to itself: “Copy that.”

The next day, they lined up on the parallel runways again — 
“This is a tricky one,” — Wind said, “but you can do it.”

She lowered her canopy and started her checklist.

“Crosswind from your right, seven knots, gusting to ten,” 
her Dragon advised, calm and clear.
“I’ve got it,” Sophie replied, eyes fixed ahead.

Sophie’s eGull began its takeoff roll, 
A gust hit, hard. The eGull veered left, then right.

“Abort the takeoff—Abort now—” her Dragon’s voice was quick now, firm.
But Sophie kept chasing the centerline. 

Another gust — stronger, the right wing lifted.
Still on the ground, the eGull started to roll on one wheel.

Her Dragon’s voice cut in, calm but firm: "I have the controls.”
The pedals moved, the stick shifted — the eGull steadied, straightened, 
slowed, exited the runway and rolled to a stop, dead straight.

“Sophie, flight instruction is over for today. 
Taxi to the ramp, when ready, please.” — 
the Dragon voice came in soft, but formal.

Wind was already in the air, "Are you okay?" — he asked over the radio.

Sophie sat rigid, she clicked the transmit.  
“I’m fine,” she said through clenched teeth, — "Aborted takeoff."

Wind thought she’d had a rough time. 
He landed, came to comfort her.
“I’m fine,” she said again.

It wasn’t the gusts that had scared her most — 
it was the Dragon taking control.
She felt like that day in Paris.

Wind felt helpless. Their easy trust — 
nothing between them — was gone. 

He tried — warm tea with a flower smell,
her rose mug with “kindness” on it.

“Don’t move my stuff,” Sophie said, pointing to the bag.

“It's in the doorway,” he said. “I put it back.”

She stepped into the doorway. “Leave it.”

She looked at him, eyes hard. He left. 
And the door closed softly between them. 
The latch clicked.

They were like two young seagulls in a gust — 
stalling, tumbling, feathers ruffled — 
dropping toward the ocean. 
The water hit like ice.

Sophie wasn’t sure what had come over her.

That night, she took out her journal —  
she was taught that she should work on  
relationships and ask for help and support.

She wrote:  
“Today we went flying and I almost died.  
The Dragon never even said sorry. 
And Wind thought it was my own mistake.”

She whispered into the silence, 
asking for help and support.

Then flipped back through the journal. 
The pages were filled with her worst memories —  
arguments, accidents, hurts.
  
She never thought to write down the best ones.  

By morning she’d decided: *she was done with Wind*.

@comment: hidden
Empathy, self-awareness, attention, care, play, compatibility, common interests and external factors. "work" comes way down the list and easily can be negative.

The next day the eGull was ready to fly again, but Sophie never came back to the cockpit.
Her headset gathered dust in the hangar, the eGull sat silent.

She still saw Wind, but only on the ground — in cafés, on bike rides, in the park.
The sky no longer seemed to call her.

While Wind was out at the airfield, she’d found a different routine.
She liked the library and an old stone church courtyard nearby.

When he asked why, she just shrugged.
“I like it here. It’s quiet.”

Her voice was gentle, but there was a stillness in it.
Wind tried to understand, but he couldn’t.

He didn't think she should sit there alone, 
so he changed his routine — pausing on the flying,
to keep her company.

sunday: spread, landscape-oriented

One bright Sunday, Wind found her in the park, sitting on a stone bench with a book in her lap.

“Hey,” Wind said, dropping his bike beside the bench.
“Forecast’s perfect. No wind, clear skies. Let’s take the eGulls out.”

Sophie didn’t look up. She turned a page, eyes scanning the text.
“I’m busy.”

“You can read after, no? The eGulls are ready. We can fly together.”

“I said I’m busy, Wind.”
Her voice was flat, without the old teasing edge.

“Hey,” he said, sitting down beside her  
and pulling her into a hug.

Her voice wasn’t angry — just cold —  
 *“Don’t touch me.”*

He looked stunned — as if hit by a car.
Like a bird that flew into glass.

She stood and walked to the far side of the park without looking back.

Her book was still open, face down where she’d left it.
The echo of her words stayed in the air.
Wind tried to breathe and couldn’t.

Sophie is parroting what she was taught, without understanding the impact. Words were drilled into her head, and empathy was not a part of that lesson.

He went to the airfield anyway.

The sky was clear, the air still.
Wind rolled the eGull out alone.

His Dragon ran the preflight in calm, familiar tones.
Everything was in the green. Perfect conditions.

He took off, climbing into the bright air.
The hills spread below, green giving way to blue.

But the other eGull sat silent in its hangar.
No laughter over the channel when they caught lift.
He flew the pattern, landed smooth, taxied in.

Without Sophie, it wasn’t flying.
It was just… being in the air.

Sophie didn’t come to the airfield again.
Two days later, she flew back to Paris and was gone.

Wind tried calling. No answer.
He sent a message. It was read, but no reply.
He tried again. 

"Sophie, are you okay?" he typed, hoping for a response.
Nothing.

Epilogue — Back to Paris

When Sophie got back to Paris, 
her parents were waiting.

They embraced her.
She didn’t feel anything.

Her dad looked tired.
Her brother was not there.

That night she dreamed of a frozen sea, 
a seagull trapped in ice.
