A Sophie and Wind Story

@image:
Sophie standing at the rail of a bench in the Luxembourg Gardens in winter. Bare trees, pale sky, her scarf lifted by a breeze. The Eiffel Tower faint in the background. She looks toward the distance as if imagining someplace far away.

To those who know two skies—  
and still find one more to fly.

It was winter, and Wind was away.  
Every winter, he left Paris for the other side of the world.

One gray afternoon, Sophie’s mother smiled at her over the kitchen table.  
“How would you like to go to Winter Camp in California?  
It’s at Wind’s school.”  

Sophie’s spoon stopped halfway to her mouth.  
“Really?”  
“Really.”

They rode under tall redwoods.  
Wind’s neighborhood had a pool, tennis courts, and a golf course.  
“It’s called Hidden Valley,” he said.  
“It’s like living in a forest—except with ice cream nearby.”

Sunlit redwood trunks, shadows across a quiet lane. Sophie and Wind ride bikes past a swimming pool shimmering in winter light.

One afternoon, Wind led Sophie past the hangars at Reid–Hillview Airport.  
The air smelled of sun-warmed asphalt and avgas.

Rows of small airplanes on the ramp. Wind walking ahead, Sophie following, both in light jackets. Beyond them, red-and-white windsock against a bright California winter sky.

“There’s something I can do here that I can’t do in Paris,” Wind said.  

“In Paris, to fly solo, you need to be fifteen years old.  
But here…”

His eGull, sleek and small, tied down on the ramp. Its wingtips glint in the light.

“Wait — you can fly an airplane?” Sophie stared at him.  

“Yeah. I’ve been flying since I was eight,” Wind said. “Here, I can.”  

She looked at the little silver eGull. “It’s so small. Where do I sit?”  

Wind grinned. “You don’t. It’s only got one seat.”  

“One seat? That’s not fair. You can't take me?”

“No passengers,” Wind said.  
“If you want to fly with me, you have to learn.”

Close view of the eGull’s open cockpit, a single seat with harness straps. Sophie leaning in to look, her reflection faintly visible in the polished panel, Wind resting a hand on the fuselage.

"Can I fly it?” Sophie asked, eyes bright. 
"Can I get in?"

@right: page, image
View from inside the eGull, tied down on the ramp. Its wingtips glint in the light. Inside the eGull’s cockpit, both Sophie and Wind sitting side by side in the single seat, grinning. Wind flips a switch; screens come alive. On the center display, the AI co-pilot’s avatar shimmers into view — a dragon traced in flowing gold and silver lines. Its eyes brighten, tilting toward Sophie as if already measuring her.  

“It’s looking at me.”  

Wind smiles. “It’s a dragon. Here, put on the headset.”

Through the soft hiss of the headset, a warm, deliberate voice:  
*"Hello. I know Wind. But what is your name?"*

@image:
Wind’s room. A joystick and pedals pulled from a dusty box.  
Wind grins: “The dragon here is ancient — it’s like two years old. I used it when I was eight.”  
He puts on the headset: “Hey Dragon, remember me? It’s Wind.”  
Bashful Lamb sits on the bed in the background.

A low, textured hum answered.  
“Of course, Wind. You have grown taller… but your wings are still waiting.”

@image:
Sophie in the pilot chair. Two monitors show the eGull’s panel instruments; a projection on the wall glows with a sunny valley.  
The dragon’s voice fills the headset, warm and deliberate: “Let’s begin with level flight.”  
Wind sits beside her, watching.

“Sophie, you are flying too slow.”  
— The horizon tilts, stall warning beeps.  
The dragon’s voice is calm but firm: “I have control.”  

On the screen, ghostly dragon wings overlay the eGull, leveling it out.  
A beat later: “You have control.”  

“Sophie, we are going to learn stalls, but not today.  
Today is for learning to fly straight and level, at a constant airspeed, constant altitude, in a constant direction, and in balance.”

The next afternoon, Sophie sat in the real eGull, headset snug over her ears.  
Wind’s voice crackled over the radio from the grass beside the taxiway:  
“Nice and slow, okay?”  

The dragon’s voice followed, warm and deliberate:  
“Today we will learn to taxi. Use gentle pedal pressure.”  

Sophie felt the sunlight on her shoulder and the gentle rumble of the wheels beneath her feet.

The eGull rolling slowly along a sunlit taxiway.  
Wind stands off to the side with a handheld radio, hills in the background.

On her last night, the clubhouse glowed with string lights.  
A few camp friends came to say goodbye.  
There was music, paper lanterns, and a table piled high with cupcakes and cookies.  

Sophie and Wind sat on the low deck steps, kissing on the lips, unabashed. 
They knew she would be flying home the next day.

@right: page, image
The next morning at the airport, they sat side by side, watching planes taxi past.  

Two weeks of winter holidays with Wind had flown by like two years… or like one day.  
And then it was time to go back, into the winter in Paris, without Wind.  

“You can come any time, you know,” Wind said.  

“Just say the word.”  

Sophie smiled through the tears. “You’ll hear it.”

Somewhere over the ocean, Sophie closed her eyes.  
The airplane hummed, the seatbelt pressed warm against her.  
And in the quiet, she could almost hear the headset again—  

The dragon’s voice, calm and deliberate:  
“You’ll be back. And next time, you’ll have your own wings.”

Sophie in the eGull, solo*.  
The familiar dragon’s voice crackled in:  
“You are ready?”  
“Yes.”  
“You can have the controls.”  
“I have the controls.”

* Except for Bashful Lamb, who doesn’t count.
