A Sophie and Wind Story


@image:
Sophie standing at the foot of wide stone church steps, looking toward the sunny park beyond. She wears a light summer dress and sandals. In the park, colorful kites tug in the wind, leaves swirl, and children laugh in the distance. The Eiffel Tower rises faintly in the background.

Sundays had always been the same.  
Sophie’s mother would take her to the tall stone church at the end of the street.  
There were candles and echoes and long rows of people sitting very still.

“Come inside, Sophie,” her mother called.

Sophie shook her head.  

“But Mom, it’s so sunny out! And I love to play with wind.”

Her mother paused. Sophie grinned. “I think Sundays are windier than other days, because it’s sun that makes the wind.”

“Can I go to the park instead of going to the Mess?”

“Sophie, it is important to go to Mass. All your friends are going to be there.”

“Please? I really want to go, while it’s still sunny.”

“All right.”

“Thank you, Mom.”

Sophie turned and walked toward the park.

@left: page, text
In the wide grass, three younger children were trying to get a kite into the air.  
It flopped and spun in the wind, a jagged tear in its bright paper skin.  

“We can fix it,” Sophie said.  
But when she checked her pockets, all she found was two pencils, a paper square, and a phone.  
“We need tape.”  

@right: page, image
Three kids holding a sagging kite, Sophie kneeling beside them, examining the tear. Sunlit grass, playful breeze.

She thought of the pharmacy,  
but Madame Madeline—  
who always kept a roll of every kind of tape behind the counter—  
was at church.

Sophie thought hard about anything that used tape and where she could get some.  
“Let’s go to the flower shop,” she said to the kids.  
“It’s right at the edge of the park, and they’ll give us tape.”  

At the flower shop, the sign read: *Open at noon*.
Sophie stopped. Closed, closed, closed.

She tried the little café by the pond — chairs stacked, door locked.  
She looked around. The park was full of things, but none that were quite right.

She was about to pull out her phone to check the map, but she stopped.  
A boy nearby was walking toward the café, crumpling an empty water bottle.  

“Wait!” she called.  
“Can I have your bottle? It’s for a kite rescue.”  

@right: page, image
Sophie catching up to the boy with the bottle, sunlight flashing on the crinkled plastic, the kite and kids visible in the background. Boy going to the trash can near the café, but stopped to hand the bottle to Sophie.

The boy smiled at her and looked at the kite.  
They’d requisitioned one of the café tables and a few chairs as an improvised workshop.  
One of the kids had a Swiss Army knife, and in no time they’d peeled a sticky label from the bottle, trimmed it into an oval patch, and pressed it over the tear.

Children gathered around the café table, Sophie leaning over the kite, carefully pressing the patch in place.

“Oh, Wind — nice,” Sophie said, giving him a quick kiss on the cheek, “You’re late.”

“Sorry I got stuck in church.”

“It’s nice that you’re here now, in sunlight. Did you escape through a window?”

“Almost!” Wind smiled. “You know I don’t do well with all that... darkness.”

“But you went anyway.”

“Well, yeah. You were going.” He touched her hair, watching the sun play in it. “Worth it though. That color... it’s really my favorite.”

Sophie watched the kite’s tail flicker against the wide sky, took Wind’s hand and smiled—  

“Sundays are for sun and friends,” Sophie said. “And for flying stuff. Not burning candles.”  

Wind grinned. “Unless it’s on a birthday cake.”

![Inside the church during Mass. Rows and rows of people seen from a point above, somewhere in the air. Darkness and rows of gray or dark heads in foreground, background blurred. Dim light filtering through stained glass, colorful but with mostly reds and blues, no natural colors. Candles giving unnatural LED candle light. Doors closed. Windows closed, except for a single square of blue in a window high up.](snaps/church_from_above.png)

![Wind sitting in a pew, his normally bright hair dulled to grayish in the church darkness, but shadows around are placed as if Wind is a light source. He's hunched over a missalette, secretly drawing on it. The map he's creating is the only vibrant thing in the frame - bright greens of park paths, golden yellow suns, blue sky, colorful kites. One of the crosses got turned into a kite in a drawing. His pencils hidden under the pew. ](snaps/wind_drawing_in_darkness.png)

@image:
Sophie and Wind riding side-by-side through the Jardin du Luxembourg on bright bicycles. Wind’s bicycle is a vivid orange with a polished silver bell on the handlebar; Sophie’s is a bright lime green with a black rear basket. Sophie’s basket holds a fresh baguette and a bundle of lavender and wildflowers, petals catching the breeze.  

@background:
A sunlit park path lined with green lawns and flowerbeds, early-summer flowers in bloom. Behind them, a green-painted bus stop bench and shelter; on the shelter’s glass is a faded travel poster reading: *Lyra’s Oxford – Daily Service from London*. The poster’s edges are sun-faded, colors muted, but the gold lettering still catches the light.  

@light:
Warm morning tones, golden light filtering through tall chestnut trees. Long, soft shadows falling across the path.

@page: text, tiny, cursive, centered
It’s dark inside,  
but sun still finds me  
shaking shades  
where echoes unwind me.  

I stand by the steps where shadows stay,  
but sun is calling me to learn and play.  
A voice calls half-drunk, but wind says *no*—  
fly to the sunny side where wings can go.  

I warm my wings, then ride the breeze—  
with the wind and through the trees.  
Petals wide, nectar to flow—  
sun coaxes them to live and grow.  

Deep in the park I stand so wide,  
leaves drinking light on the sunlit side.  
Wind lifts my seeds to faraway ground—  
new trees grow where the light is found.  

When you know me, you’ll understand—  
I follow sun across the land.  
And Sun Days are best—  
when the sky is wide,  
with me and friends  
flying by your side.

                      Sophie and Wind.

@background:
soft watercolor leaves, drifting sunbeams, faint kite tails curling between stanzas.

Art
The generative AI art in *Sophie and Sun* is not without flaws. If you'd like to illuminate your own version, please visit [wind.kids](https://wind.kids).

Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the many magnificent ones—large and small—who have opened access to their models, technologies, and the modern digital art workshop: a true bicycle-for-the-mind. Without these tools, Sophie and Sun would never have fit within the constraints of everyday life, and simply wouldn't have been possible.

What began as a bike is now almost a fusion-powered flying dragon for the mind. With deep gratitude to the creators, scientists, engineers, artists, and dreamers who share their knowledge and imagination with the world. 

And this story was shaped by those who darken paths and close doors and hearts for others.
