Sophie and Wind — Winter Flight

A Sophie and Wind Story

@image:
Sophie standing at the rail of a bench in the Luxembourg Gardens in winter. Bare trees, pale sky, her scarf lifted by a breeze. The Eiffel Tower faint in the background. She looks toward the distance as if imagining someplace far away.

To those who know two skies—  
and still find one more to fly.

It was winter, and Wind was away.  
Every winter, he left Paris for the other side of the world.

Sophie on a bench in the Luxembourg Gardens, bundled in coat and scarf. The park is bare and quiet, the fountain drained. A single leaf skitters across the gravel path.

One gray afternoon, Sophie’s mother smiled at her over the kitchen table.  
“How would you like to go to Winter Camp in California?  
It’s at Wind’s school.”  

Sophie’s spoon stopped halfway to her mouth.  
“Really?”  
“Really.”

Taxi to the airport.  
The long security queue.

Boarding pass in her hand: *Paris → San Francisco*.

Glass walls at San Francisco International. Winter light pours in, but it’s warm and golden. Wind waits just past the barrier, grinning. Palm trees sway outside.

They rode under tall redwoods.  
Wind’s neighborhood had a pool, tennis courts, and a golf course.  
“It’s called Hidden Valley,” he said.  
“It’s like living in a forest—except with ice cream nearby.”

Sunlit redwood trunks, shadows across a quiet lane. Sophie and Wind ride bikes past a swimming pool shimmering in winter light.

The courtyard of the French-American School of Silicon Valley. Children play in mixed groups, some calling out in French, some in English. Sophie and Wind sit together on a low wall, laughing.

One afternoon, Wind led Sophie past the hangars at Reid-Hillview Airport.  
On the tarmac stood a small silver-and-white airplane with swept wings.  

“This is my eGull,” Wind said. “It’s my dragon.”  
“No passengers allowed. If you want to fly with me, you have to learn yourself.”

@image:
Wind’s room. A joystick and pedals pulled from a dusty box.  
Wind grins: “The dragon here is ancient — it’s like two years old. I used it when I was eight.”  
He puts on the headset: “Hey Dragon, remember me? It’s Wind.”  
Bashful Lamb sits on the bed in the background.

A low, textured hum answered.  
“Of course, Wind. You have grown taller… but your wings are still waiting.”

@image:
Sophie in the pilot chair. Two monitors show the eGull’s panel instruments; a projection on the wall glows with a sunny valley.  
The dragon’s voice fills the headset, warm and deliberate: “Let’s begin with level flight.”  
Wind sits beside her, watching.

“Sophie, you are flying too slow.”  
— The horizon tilts, stall warning beeps.  
The dragon’s voice is calm but firm: “I have control.”  

On the screen, ghostly dragon wings overlay the eGull, leveling it out.  
A beat later: “You have control.”  

“Sophie, we are going to learn stalls, but not today.  
Today is for learning to fly straight and level, at a constant airspeed, constant altitude, in a constant direction, and in balance.”

The next afternoon, Sophie sat in the real eGull, headset on.  
Wind’s voice came over the radio from the grass beside the taxiway.  
The dragon’s voice followed: “Taxi to the hold short line. Use gentle pedal pressure.”

The eGull rolling slowly along a sunlit taxiway, Sophie’s hands steady on the controls.

Sophie in the eGull, solo*.  
The familiar dragon’s voice crackled in:  
“You are ready?”  
“Yes.”  
“You can have the controls.”  
“I have the controls.”  

---
* Except for Bashful Lamb, who doesn’t count.

Sophie banked gently, keeping her airspeed, altitude, and balance—  
flying not just in Wind’s world, but in her own.

With thanks to those who imagine, build, and share freely—
