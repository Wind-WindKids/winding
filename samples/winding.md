Sophie and Sun Day

@image:
Sophie standing at the foot of wide stone church steps, looking toward the sunny park beyond. She wears a light summer dress and sandals. In the park, colorful kites tug in the wind, leaves swirl, and children laugh in the distance. The Eiffel Tower rises faintly in the background.

Two sketchbooks in the grass, one with pencil drawings of kites and another with watercolor swatches. A picnic blanket with a thermos and paper cups. In the distance, Sophie walks toward the park, sunlight on her hair.

To Lyra Belacqua,  
who taught us that the sky is wide,  
and the world is enough.

Sundays had always been the same.  
Sophie’s mother would take her to the tall stone church at the end of the street.  
There were candles and echoes and long rows of people sitting very still.

“Come inside, Sophie,” her mother called.

Sophie shook her head.  
“I want to be where the light is. And I love to play with wind,” she said.  

Sophie shook her head. “I want to be where the light is. And I love to play with wind.”

Her mother paused. Sophie grinned. “I think Sundays are windier than other days, because it’s sun that makes the wind.”

“Can I go to the park instead of going to the Mess?”

“Sophie, it is Mass, not mess — and it is important to go. All your friends are going to be there.”

“Please? I really want to go, while it’s still sunny.”

“All right.”

“Thank you, Mom.”

Sophie turned and walked toward the park.

In the wide grass, three younger children were trying to get a kite into the air.  
It flopped and spun in the wind, a jagged tear in its bright paper skin.  

“We can fix it,” Sophie said.  
But when she checked her pockets, all she found was two pencils, a paper square, and a phone.  
“We need tape.”

She thought of the pharmacy,  
but Madame Madeline—  
who always kept a roll of every kind of tape behind the counter—  
was at church.

Sophie thought hard about anything that used tape and where she could get some.  
“Let’s go to the flower shop,” she said to the kids.  
“It’s right at the edge of the park, and they’ll give us tape.”  

At the flower shop, the sign read: *Open at noon*.

She tried the little café by the pond — chairs stacked, door locked.  

Sophie sighed.  
She looked around. The park was full of things, but none that were quite right.

She was about to pull out her phone to check the map, but she stopped.  
A boy nearby was walking toward the café, crumpling an empty water bottle.  

“Wait!” she called, jogging over.  
“Can I have your bottle? It’s for a kite rescue.”

Sophie catching up to the boy with the bottle, sunlight flashing on the crinkled plastic, the kite and kids visible in the background.

The boy smiled at her and looked at the kite.  
They’d requisitioned one of the café tables and a few chairs as an improvised workshop.  
One of the kids had a Swiss Army knife, and in no time they’d peeled a sticky label from the bottle, trimmed it into an oval patch, and pressed it over the tear.

Children gathered around the café table, Sophie leaning over the kite, carefully pressing the patch in place.

Her phone chimed gently.  
**Sorry got stuck. You are not at the church today? I only go because you go.**

Sophie watched the kite’s tail flicker against the wide sky and smiled—

@page: text, tiny, cursive, centered
I stand by the steps where shadows stay,
but sun is calling me to learn and play.
A voice calls half-drunk, but wind says *no*—
fly to the sunny side where kites can go.

I warm my wings, then ride the breeze—
following wind between the trees.
Petals wide, nectar flows—
sun coaxes them to love and grow.

Deep in the park stands a tree so wide,
leaves drinking light on the sunlit side.
I lift its seeds to faraway ground—
new trees grow where the light is found.

When you know me, you’ll understand—
I follow sun across the land.
And Sun Days are best when the sky is wide,  
with me and friends flying by your side.

@background:
soft watercolor leaves, drifting sunbeams, faint kite tails curling between stanzas.
