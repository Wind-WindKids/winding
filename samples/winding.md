Sophie and Wind

@image:
Sophie sitting on a wooden park bench. She wears large, headphones and looks at her phone, smiling slightly. Leaves drift around her, and small birds and flowers surround the scene, creating a gentle, whimsical atmosphere. In the background, the Eiffel Tower rises through a light mist, and a red-orange kite flies in the sky.

@headphones:
Primarily turquoise blue with peachy-orange ear pads and a yellow-gold accent ring around the pads. The cord is also turquoise.

@phone:
muted teal blue, closely matching the color of her headphones. It's a simple, modern smartphone design with clean edges. there's no visible logo or brand name.

Sophie liked to sit on a bench in a big, quiet park in Paris. She wore her headphones and looked at pictures on her phone. The park was peaceful, but she still felt a little lonely.

@background:
Flowers at the border, small birds, leaves flying, wind patterns.

One day, she saw something strange under the bench. It was a small book. The cover was soft like leather, and the pages were full of scribbles and drawings—like secret codes!
She almost put it back. But then… she opened it.

@image: !headphones, anchor
Sophie kneeling beside the bench, brushing away leaves. Book half-hidden. Light catching the book. Autumn tones, golden leaves.

Inside were riddles—like puzzles—that talked about places in the park.

So, she stood up and followed the first clue.

Some clues were tricky! She got one wrong and ended up staring at a pigeon-filled courtyard for an hour. 

But soon, she started finding tiny treasures.

She felt thirsty and frustrated when searching for the last clue.  

She sat on a bench and looked at her phone.  

But she took a few sips from her water bottle and continued.

The last clue talked about a big old tree:  

"Where the roots are always felt."  

She looked and looked.  
She was about to give up.  
The hollow was hard to find.

Inside was a folded note,  
like the pages in the book.  

It simply said:  
> You are here.  
> The tree is always here.  
> And never the same.  
> Just like you.  

That was all.  

Sophie put the note back  
and hid the book inside.

@page: text, tiny, cursive, centered 
I stand so still, but wind,
still finds me,
shaking light where dreams unwind me.

Start where the kites go up to the sky—
and I wave the clouds drifting by.
Follow the path where leaves like to dance—
they’ll show you the way if you give them a chance.

Around and around with songs we spin,
where I get dizzy and laugh with a grin.
I carry the boats with my gentle hand,
across the pond, toward sunny land.
I buzz and bloom and whisper low—
sweet things happen where no one knows.

I can play without an end,
at the tree where the roots are always felt.
But the sun sets low, and time 
stands still, and even wind 
is tucked in bed.
                                    Wind.

@background:
silver kite, wind patterns, drifting leaves, and a subtle motif of wind sleeping.

Art
The generative AI art in *Sophie and Wind* is not without flaws. If you'd like to illuminate your own version, please visit [wind.kids](https://wind.kids).

Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the many magnificent ones—large and small—who have opened access to their models, technologies, and the modern digital art workshop: a true bicycle-for-the-mind. Without these tools, Sophie and Wind would never have fit within the constraints of everyday life, and simply wouldn’t have been possible.

What began as a bike is now almost a fusion-powered flying dragon for the mind.

With deep gratitude to the creators, scientists, engineers, artists, and dreamers who share their knowledge and imagination with the world. This story was shaped by those who light paths and open doors and hearts for others.
