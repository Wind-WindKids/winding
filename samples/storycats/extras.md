The cats kept a library, full of storybooks.

Trish would go to the library, open a right page, and read: "On the next day Twap ..."

@image:
Trish, on the table with a lamp, pawing a book and reading from a page, in the storybooks library full of brown, gray and black books. On the pages, a lot of small text, but the left page starts with larger: On the next day Twap

And the cat would be back, with a turn of a page, even better than before.

@image: Twap, shining

And Aria, now a storycat, had a page too,
safe and secure, and in that library.
