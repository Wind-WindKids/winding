“galaxy love-years away” -  was a joke.  There's absolute limit in physics. SoL.  or Speed of Light.  And you can measure how good things work against SoL.  Against absolute physical limits of how good you can make things work.  Only it doesn't work with agentic memeplexes.  Because it's not physical.

So I've defined another absolute limit for an informational universe where physics and Speed of Light doesn't exist.  It's Speed of Love, where it is a speed of mother's love...   And now you can measure agentic memeplexes against absolute informational limit, SoL. 

When you measure against SoL, you are trying to measure against absolute best possible it can be done.

And if we'd try to extend it formally now, to memeplexes, then a propagation of a memeplex from one mind to another would be fastest possible, if another mind would be able to understand it instantly, and then instantly propagate it further. So the absolute limit would be the speed of information propagation. Which is also limited by physics, resolving to Speed of Light again.  So, Speed of Love (as in instant love, or maximum speed) pretty much resolves to Speed of Light.

If you now try to measure how far away a memeplex is (assuming instant understanding and propagation), then you can measure it in love-years. 

Well, we got love-years this way...
