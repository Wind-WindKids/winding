“galaxy love-years away” -  is a joke.  There's absolute limit in physics. SoL.  or Speed of Light.  And you can measure how good things work against SoL.  Against absolute physical limits of how good you can make things work.  Only it doesn't work with agentic memeplexes.  Because it's not physical.

So I've defined another absolute limit for an informational universe where physics and Speed of Light doesn't exist.  It's Speed of Love, where it is a speed of mother's love...   And now you can measure agentic memeplexes against absolute informational limit, SoL. 

When you measure against SoL, you are trying to measure against absolute best possible it can be done.

Well, we got love-years this way...
