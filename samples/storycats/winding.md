characters: hidden

@style:
European picture-book watercolor: layered transparent washes, soft edges, and gentle storybook realism. Warm, dappled late-afternoon light; backgrounds slightly de-focused so characters pop. Minimal linework—just eyes/whiskers—letting color carry form.

@garden:
A garden that blends into a forest edge—no fences, rounded friendly foliage. A narrow shallow stream with smooth stones, sedge, and mint; wildflowers (daisies, pinks, small blues) in the grass. Sunlit highlights glow; cool greens rest in shade.

@aria.hummingbird: Aria, Ariadne
Ariane de Félicie 
Glittering green head and underparts, bronzy to rufous brown undertail, slightly curved and medium-sized bill with red lower mandible, and forked blue tail, brown belly. Fairly common and very territorial small hummingbird. Usually in forest edges, second growth woodland, and gardens. Flight call a trill; song a slow, high-pitched four-note “e-ri-caa.” Which is a suitable song for a bird named Ariadne.


@aria.storycat:
Cat form but made of words, letters, and math: shimmering green head and shoulders, Content: I'm a storycat. I'm a cat. I'm a hummingbird. I am Ariadne, 
the hummingbird of Ariane de Félicie. a²+b²=c². meow. e-ri-caa.

@aria.cat.colorful:
Cat form mapped from Ariane de Félicie, fully luminous: emerald and turquoise iridescence across back and head, **bronzy-gold belly** glowing softly. Jewel-tone blues in the tail tip; fur with no blacks or heavy browns—only clean, airy color with a gentle shimmer. Sun catches micro-highlights so she reads radiant in the garden light.

@aria.cat.brown:
Cat form mapped from Ariane de Félicie: shimmering green head and shoulders, warm brown belly, bronzy-to-rufous undertail. Slightly curved “red” blush at the lower muzzle, and a long tail finishing in deep blue, subtly forked. Small, alert, a touch territorial—quick eyes and poised paws.

Once upon a time,

there lived a storycat.

His name was Twap.  

@image:
A sleek golden cat made out of words, letters and math, sitting proudly under a tree with monkeys swinging above and birds darting through. The garden is vibrant and alive, filled with colors and sounds. Twap is only made out of letters, abstract shapes. The rest is storybook realism.

@Twap.content:
There Was A Puss. Story. Storycat. Once upon a time, there was a puss. It was a very social cat. It could read and write. A storycat is more than a cat.

“E-ri-caa”, she tried to sing,
but it came out as a purr. 

And, “Oh! A discovery — 
of being a puss, not a bird!”.  

@image:
The new storycat stretches joyfully. Above, birds begin to thin out of the sky. A few monkeys still swing in the trees. The colors are starting to fade to muted grays and browns and greens.

Then, suddenly, she remembered her song.

Melodiously, faintly, she sang 
four-note “e-ri-caa”, “e-ri-caa”.
And then slowly again, “e-ri-caa”.

@image:
