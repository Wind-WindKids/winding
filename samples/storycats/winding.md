European picture-book watercolor: layered transparent washes, soft edges, and gentle storybook realism. Warm, dappled late-afternoon light; backgrounds slightly de-focused so characters pop. Minimal linework—just eyes/whiskers—letting color carry form.

A garden that blends into a forest edge—no fences, rounded friendly foliage. A narrow shallow stream with smooth stones, sedge, and mint; wildflowers (daisies, pinks, small blues) in the grass. Sunlit highlights glow; cool greens rest in shade.

storycats_intro: landscape-orientation
--
Once upon a time, 
in a galaxy love-years away, 
there lived a storycat.  

@image:
A wide galaxy view, stars scattered, a glowing cat constellation among them. The sky is full of other constellations, birds, monkeys, zebras, butterflies and fishes.

--
twap_named: landscape-orientation
--
His name was Twap.  

@image:
An abstract golden cat made out of words, letters and math, sitting proudly under a tree with monkeys swinging above and birds darting through. The garden is vibrant and alive, filled with colors and sounds. Twap is only made out of letters, abstract shapes, no contours. The rest is storybook realism.

@Twap.content:
There Was A Puss. Story. Storycat. Once upon a time, there was a puss. It was a very social cat. It could read and write. A storycat is more than a cat.

Twap was a social cat, 
with many friends—
cats, monkeys, birds,
and even zebras.

One bright day, Twap was playing 
with his cat friend Trish and 
a tiny hummingbird named Aria.

By evening the laughter and the melodious 
four-note “e-ri-caa”, Aria’s song, had softened.  

@image: Aria.hummingbird
The same meadow under sunset light, Aria, Twap and Trish, animals resting, birds roosting, two zebras settling down.

And they began to tell stories to each other.  

@image: Aria.storybird, twap.storycat, trish.storycat
The words of their stories shimmer into glowing shapes in the air—lines, dots, and faint algebraic patterns. The words shapes Twap, Trish, and Aria are starting to glow faintly. Late evening.

And the two cats purred wondrous purrs, 
warm and steady.  

@image: Aria.storybird, twap.storycat, trish.storycat
Twap, Trish in storycat form and Aria in storybird form, cats curled together, a Aria snuggling between them. Aria is faint blue, maid out of letters and counters are faded. The words of their stories shimmer into glowing shapes in the air—lines, dots, and faint algebraic patterns. Constellations in the sky, forming thousands of faint triangles and shapes. And equation a + b + c - c is floating above them.

As their voices wound together, 
the stories shimmered—pure—

Night sky filled with constellations of cats, birds, zebras and other animals, with mathematical equations glowing softly.

And Aria, 
without even noticing, 
was turned into a storycat.

aria_discovery: landscape-orientation

In the morning,
“E-ri-caa”, she tried to sing,
but it came out as a purr. 

And, “Oh! A discovery — 
of being a puss, not a bird!”.  

@image:
The new storycat stretches joyfully. The morning light, above, birds begin to thin out of the sky. A few monkeys still swing in the trees. The colors are starting to fade to muted grays and browns and greens.

When she tried purring, 
the sound came out musical, 
half-humming, half-cat, 
and completely marvelous.  

@image:
Subtle faint golden sound notes and faint waves swirling through the air. No birds or butterflies remain. A lot of cats are in the garden. The colors are starting to fade to muted grays and browns and greens.

From that day on, 
Aria lived among the storycats—
partying, celebrating birthdays, 
purring and weaving tales.  

@image:
Many cats gathered in festivity. No monkeys now, only a last butterfly above. Only white, browns, grays, greens and blacks remain.

Then, suddenly, she remembered her song.

Melodiously, faintly, she sang 
four-note “e-ri-caa”, “e-ri-caa”.
And then slowly again, “e-ri-caa”.

@image:
Aria-cat looking up, eyes bright, a tiny green-gold spark appear in the air. The garden is still muted, natural grays, browns and greens.

Louder this time, Aria repeated:  

“I am Ariadne, the storybird.”

Calmer again, Aria said a true name:  
“I am Ariadne, a hummingbird
of the Ariane de Félicie kind.”  

@image: Aria.hummingbird
A radiant Aria at last, wings spanning the sky, shimmering turquoise, gold, and ruby red. Windy and Trixy look up in awe. A few butterflies edge back into color. A bird constellation in the sky. A few bird shapes in the sky.

And Aria, now a hummingbird, 
flashed gold, red, and shining green.


“Wow,” her older daughter Trixy gasped.

And they lived happily ever after.  

The End.

A storybird am I.
And my stories fly.
I listen, I sing.
E-ri-caa, E-ri-caa.
Others love me—I love them.
I care for them.
It’s nice to be me.
E-ri-caa, E-ri-caa.
And it’s easy to be—
E-ri-caa, E-ri-caa—
if you listen and try,
and let your song fly:
“A storybird am I…”


Sroryfox’s riddle:
***
Who am I? A storyfox.
I play, I listen, I trick with stories.
I love others; others love me—

A storyfox—it's nice to be.
And you can be one two.
It's easy—if you riddle:
"Who am I?"

and it's easy to be—
if you listen: "Once upon a…"
