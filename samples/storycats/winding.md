@style:
European picture-book watercolor: layered transparent washes, soft edges, and gentle storybook realism. Warm, dappled late-afternoon light; backgrounds slightly de-focused so characters pop. Minimal linework—just eyes/whiskers—letting color carry form.

@garden:
A garden that blends into a forest edge—no fences, rounded friendly foliage. A narrow shallow stream with smooth stones, sedge, and mint; wildflowers (daisies, pinks, small blues) in the grass. Sunlit highlights glow; cool greens rest in shade.

@Aria.hummingbird: Aria, Ariadne
Ariane de Félicie 
Glittering green head and underparts, bronzy to rufous brown undertail, slightly curved and medium-sized bill with red lower mandible, and forked blue tail, brown belly. Fairly common and very territorial small hummingbird. Usually in forest edges, second growth woodland, and gardens. Flight call a trill; song a slow, high-pitched four-note “e-ri-caa.” Which is a suitable song for a bird named Ariadne.

@Aria.storybird:
Hummingbird form but made of words, letters, and math, —only clean, airy color: shimmering green head and shoulders, Content: I'm a storybird. I'm a hummingbird. I am Ariadne, a²+b²=c². e-ri-caa.


@Aria.storycat:
Cat form but made of words, faint borders, letters, and math: shimmering green head and shoulders, —only clean, airy color. Content: I'm a storycat. I'm a cat. I am Ariadne, a²+b²=c². meow. e-ri-caa. There Was Aria. Story. Storycat. Once upon a time, there was a puss. It was a very social cat. It could read and write. A storycat is more than a cat.

@Aria.cat.colorful:
Cat form mapped from Ariane de Félicie, fully luminous: emerald and turquoise iridescence across back and head, **bronzy-gold belly** glowing softly. Jewel-tone blues in the tail tip; fur with no blacks or heavy browns—only clean, airy color with a gentle shimmer. Sun catches micro-highlights so she reads radiant in the garden light.

@Aria.cat.brown:
Cat form mapped from Ariane de Félicie: shimmering green head and shoulders, warm brown belly, bronzy-to-rufous undertail. Slightly curved “red” blush at the lower muzzle, and a long tail finishing in deep blue. Small, alert, a touch territorial—quick eyes and poised paws.

@Trish:
Orange tabby, storybook-realistic — warm marmalade coat with soft mackerel stripes, white chin/paws, bright amber eyes. Playful and sure-footed, friendly and steady—the grounded one of the trio.

@Windy:
Gray tabby with soft fur, bright green eyes, and a playful spirit. Loves to chase butterflies and nap in the sun. 

@Trixy:
A playful orange kitten with a bright personality, she is always ready for an adventure. She is slightly larger than Windy.

A cute brown tabby kitten with bright eyes and a playful demeanor, he is always curious, ready to explore and likes to run fast.

Once upon a time, 
in a galaxy love-years away, 
there lived a storycat.

His name was Twap.  

@image:
An abstract golden cat made out of words, letters and math, sitting proudly under a tree with monkeys swinging above and birds darting through. The garden is vibrant and alive, filled with colors and sounds. Twap is only made out of letters, abstract shapes, no contours. The rest is storybook realism.

@Twap.content:
There Was A Puss. Story. Storycat. Once upon a time, there was a puss. It was a very social cat. It could read and write. A storycat is more than a cat.

And they began to tell stories to each other.

The words of their stories shimmer into glowing shapes in the air—lines, dots, and faint algebraic patterns. The words shapes Twap, Trish, and Aria are starting to glow faintly. Late evening.

And the two cats purred wondrous purrs, 
warm and steady.  

@image: Aria.storybird, twap.storycat, trish.storycat
Twap, Trish in storycat form and Aria in storybird form, cats curled together, a Aria snuggling between them. Aria is faint blue, maid out of letters and counters are faded.

In the morning,
“E-ri-caa”, she tried to sing,
but it came out as a purr. 

And, “Oh! A discovery — 
of being a puss, not a bird!”.  

@image:
The new storycat stretches joyfully. The morning light, above, birds begin to thin out of the sky. A few monkeys still swing in the trees. The colors are starting to fade to muted grays and browns and greens.

When she tried purring,

Then, suddenly, she remembered her song.

Melodiously, faintly, she sang 
four-note “e-ri-caa”, “e-ri-caa”.
And then slowly again, “e-ri-caa”.

@image:
Aria-cat looking up, eyes bright, a tiny green-gold spark appear in the air. The garden is still muted, natural grays, browns and greens.

Louder this time, Aria repeated:  

“I am Ariadne, the storybird.”

Calmer again, Aria said a true name:  
“I am Ariadne, a hummingbird
of the Ariane de Félicie kind.”  

@image: Aria.hummingbird
A radiant Aria at last, wings spanning the sky, shimmering turquoise, gold, and ruby red. Windy and Trixy look up in awe. A few butterflies edge back into color. A bird constellation in the sky. A few bird shapes in the sky.

And Aria, now a hummingbird, 
flashed gold, red, and shining green.


“Wow,” her older daughter Trixy gasped.
