implementation_notes: guide
---
Each winding should produce Python code that:
1. Uses pre-trained models when possible (HuggingFace, TensorFlow.js)
2. Runs on modest hardware (M2 MacBook perfect)
3. Has visual, interactive output
4. Includes "How AI Works" explanations
5. Collects data ethically
6. Produces science fair ready visualizations

@python_libraries:
- transformers  # HuggingFace models
- opencv-python  # Computer vision
- sounddevice  # Audio input
- streamlit  # Quick UIs
- matplotlib  # Graphs for science fair
- PIL  # Image processing

@teaching_moments:
Every project should naturally introduce:
- What is training data?
- How does AI learn patterns?
- Why does accuracy matter?
- What are ethics in AI?
- How to present findings?

@progression:
Age 6-8: Recognition tasks (my_first_ai, pet_translator)
Age 9-11: Analysis tasks (emotion_detector, recyclable_sorter)
Age 12-14: Generation tasks (music_mood_generator, story_continue_ai)
Age 15+: Research tasks (custom models, paper writing)
