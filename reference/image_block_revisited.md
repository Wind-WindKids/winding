Image Block Revisited, as an Agent

@image: wind-on-the-grass.png, cutout, square
I'm just testing, sorry.
This is not defining a new image. It’s sending a message to image, saying:

"Become wind-on-the-grass.png, and take on the traits cutout, square."
Everything that follows in the current space is assumed to talk to that now-transformed image — unless another agent is addressed.

You're speaking to something, not defining it. But you are using true names.
