smalltalk: comic, portrait-orientation

@style: nwind, illuminating, hand-drawn, sketchy

@outline: !visible
It's kind of like if USD, CSS, Smalltalk, Markdown and Python got together on a windy day, and reminiscing GML had taught a trick or two to a new kid on the block. 

And then, it is kind of like if Feynman, as if he was there all along, explained state spaces, interactions, retroactivity and stable points to the kid really clearly. That when illuminating, messages are like light going over all paths and bouncing off the spatial boundaries, and attenuating. And then they went to fly their dragons, and when they were back, the kid was like, "I get it now! It's like when I fly a dragon, I need to think of all the paths other dragons can take, and how they interact with the wind and the terrain, the clouds and the sun. And dance with them. It's like a dance of information!" And Feynman smiled, knowing that the kid had totally grasped it.

@explanation: !visible
Based on most recognizable photos from Wikipedia. Characters wear their usual clothes. Each character is a personification of a programming language, a technology or a concept that influenced the development of Winding Markdown. Each one is introduced with a sketchy outline and a short description.

@Markdown: character, image, anchor  
Based on ![Aaron Swartz Photo](images/anchors/photos/aaron_swartz.jpg)

@CSS: character, image, anchor  
Based on ![Håkon Wium Lie Photo](images/anchors/photos/hakon_wium_lie.jpg)

@USD: character, image, anchor  
Based on ![Steve Jobs Photo](images/anchors/photos/steve_jobs.jpg)

@USD.explanation: !visible  
The Universal Scene Description (USD) was first used internally by Pixar in the film Brave (2012) as part of their Presto system; that movie was “dedicated with love and gratitude to Steve Jobs.”

@Feynman.explanation: !visible
Feynman appears as a double nod—to someone who would likely grasp the “illumination” metaphor (QED). Winding is an underdefined state space with boundaries and illumination is like quantum mechanics where observation collapses the wave function, but here each partial illumination creates constraints that propagate through the system, settling to a coherent state from an underdefined one. There's also a nod to NVIDIA’s “Feynman” GPU architecture. That’s why his dragon form is rendered in powerful green strokes (#76b900) and there is an abrupt top-landing before a perfect flight after relaunch.
