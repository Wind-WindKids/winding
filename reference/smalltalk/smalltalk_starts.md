smalltalk_starts: page, portrait-orientation
---
A small group, chit-chatting.

--
the_gathering: panel, wide, large
--
Markdown, CSS, USD, Smalltalk, Python and Wind sit together on a grassy hill, chatting. GML stands nearby, looking at the ridge.

@background: early-morning mist, soft sunlight on grass, a few dragons flying, distant paraglider silhouettes, low to the ground.

--
usd_talking: panel, square
--
USD leans forward, eyes tracing a blue dragon skimming gravel below.

@bubble: text, small, italic  
"Look at that blue dragonâ€”she's catching lift right off the gravel streaks."

@detail:  
Dragon is quite low, barely clearing the hillside tree line. The gravel patch is a mix of light and dark, with some patches glistening in the sunlight.

python_reply: panel, wide

Python nods thoughtfully, adjusting his scripting gloves.

@bubble:
"Yeah, I see it. She's timing her turns perfectly. I'm not sure I could do that. I'd probably end up in a tree."

smalltalk_laughs: panel, square
--
Smalltalk laughs, coffee cup in hand, turning to GML.

@bubble: 
"Remember that time?"

@cup: brown, green, paper
A coffee cup with a kite logo and a travel lid.

smalltalk_anecdote: panel, wide
--
@bubble:
"One misplaced bracket and the whole code tree spiraled. I thought I was going to end up in that tree too!"

@background:
A misty cloud over the ridge looks suspiciously like a bracket.

--
markdown_reflection: panel, tall
--
Markdown gazes toward the ridge, at the whispy clouds suddenly appearing and looking suspiciously like brackets.

@markdown.thoughts: cloud, text, small, handwritten  
"Brackets always sneak back in. And in the retrospective, they are nearly always a hazard."
