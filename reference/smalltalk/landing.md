The group descends and touches down into a small sunlit clearing at the side of a canyon. Lush grass carpets the floor and a narrow stream glints between rocky walls down below.

GML landed already, in the human form, Python still soaring high, barely visible in the sky.

Feynman, in human form, looks at Wind and USD, who had just finished transforming back into their human forms.

@bubble:
"In retrospective, it was a good call to not launch too early, right Wind?"

Wind looks happy, flying was indeed as good as it gets.

The group is together again. The canyon stretches behind them, the sun shining brightly. Wind is smiling, looking at the sky, and Feynman is looking at Wind.

@bubble:
"That was a great flight! I'm maybe getting it now, Feynman. Our dragon dance, when we are anticipating each other, harmonizing and flying together, is a little bit like the information dance when winding and illuminating a story."
