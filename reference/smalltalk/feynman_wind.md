Wind lifts a finger to his lips, thoughtful.

The blue dragon, failing to catch any lift beats its wings in short, powerful strokes. The sunlight gleams off its body, pixelated quads are visible, as the dragon adjusts her flying configuration. She is now well below the ridge.

Wind shifts involuntarily: one hand sliding to his hip while the other floats outward, fingers splayed as if echoing the dragon’s wingbeat. A faint pixelation ripples along his arms and torso, hinting at a draconic form.

Wind catches himself, the pixelation receding as he steadies his stance.
