The group is shifting, some pixelation and quads are visible on the arms. Expressions are no longer bored, faces looking intense.

Wind surges forward, feet leaving the ground as golden iridescent wings unfurl in a blur of quads. USD follows in lockstep, his transform seamless—wings slicing the air smoothly and silently.
