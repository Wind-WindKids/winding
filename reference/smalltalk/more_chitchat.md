Smalltalk points out the ridge, under the misty clouds that look a bit less like brackets now. The early morning thermal starting to lift gently from the hillside, implying conditions may improve soon.

@bubble:
"Look at those streaks of wind on the grass, on the hillside."

Wind, clearly anxious to launch, listens impatiently as the adults discuss conditions calmly.

@bubble:
"Yeah, should we launch now? I think I could have caught that one."

@GML.bubble:
"Be patient, Wind. It is still too light. See this green dragon?"

A striking, iridescent green dragon swoops dramatically toward the hilltop, startling the group.

@dragon:
A metallic green dragon, iridescent, with a hint of blue and gold in the sunlight. It's a bit smaller than a hang glider, with a sleek, aerodynamic design. It looks a bit too precise, to be biological, but it is not a drone either. It is a dragon, and it is alive.

The dragon lands somewhat abruptly, scattering dust and causing slight disarray among gear and group members.
