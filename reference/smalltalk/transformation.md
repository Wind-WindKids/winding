An emerald-green dragon begins folding its wings, wingtips contract as the wings pixelate, fragmenting into quads and pixels.

Human/dragon transforms without menace, casual. Like in Airbender or Luca, but with pixelation. Obviously some advanced nanotech at work there, handling a quick redistribution of matter from an object the size of the hang glider to a human size. But the magic of it is efficient, not flashy and it fades into the background, like good technology should.

dragon_transformation_head: panel, square
--
Pixelation and quades cascade from the dragon’s head; a faint human silhouette (Feynman) emerges.

--
dragon_transformation_body: panel, square
--
The body pixelates, flesh and fabric take shape mid-transition. A quad mesh forms the outline of a face.

Nanotech weaves pixelated iridescent dragon body into skin and clothes seamlessly.

--
dragon_transformation_face: panel, square
--
Feynman’s face emerges from the pixelated quad mesh, slightly angled and amused.

--
feynman_arrival: panel, wide, large
--
Richard Feynman stands where the dragon once was, dusting pixels off himself casually. The group waves, warmly, but nonchalantly.

Feynman brushes pixel-dust off his jacket, smiling at the group.
