winding.vm.requirements : architecture
===
Winding Markdown runs in an illumination (AI-complete code execution) environment. 
Not the highest priority, but it'd be good to abstract it away with a VM.  In particular clarify requirements, so windings could be reliably transferred between illumination environments. 
Maybewind, illuminate, 'unwind' operations could be enough (?), but it's a bit hard to tell. It'd be good to understand the minimum set of operations that could qualify VM environment.
